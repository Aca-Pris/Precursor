## Lore

Lums are silver light, often taking the form of an orb.

A lum could bring a new creature into existence; a permanent cycle had been established, where life had to expire for the next generation to be born. 

Those who coveted many lums became far stronger. Namely the few self-proclaimed inheritors. Who used lums to create Domains. 
However these Domains often required Lum energies to regulate, and so the Inheritors grew less confident in their ability to remain gods - Returning to Mar to covet more Lums from the dying world. 

A being without lums was known as a Figment. Figments could only exist under specific circumstances, usually if trapped within
Adamantine. Many would've-been-inheritors instead became motionless figments.

Many tried to find alternatives to Lums; Such as the droids. Who seeked to use the byproducts of a Lum instead of the Lum itself. This was somewhat successful but still limited by the availability of lums.
