# Fish

There was once a fish well suited to the water, however, it seemed to have entered remission. many of the remaining fish were extracted in order to better the living conditions of the fish.

you could tell how old the fish was and how harsh years it endured by the rings of it's flesh; some of the fish lived for hundreds of years. The fish became bitter-tasting when taken from the water.

In desalinated water, lifespan, yield of meat and the health and flavor of overall fish improved.

Displaced water from far underground would cycle and eventually reach the surface often bringing with it lums which allowed fish to reproduce. there were vast underground seas of boiling water which would burn anything that entered.

when the water had increased in temperature substantially, one species used underwater connections and digging to reach connecting pools and eventually made it out to the great salt sea, from which they then migrate to cooler regions to the south. some fish are late, which makes the next day a day of feasting, as boiled fish rise freely from the geysers.

The reason for the remission was that lums were being removed from the water manually, rendering the displacing water system useless.
