* Precursor Lords can control anywhere from 0-300 units. The units can automate themselves with no player-involvement. If the player however does work on a unit, it will become a companion instead of a regular unit.
* Any unit in your Domain can be sent to locations for activities. This can be exploration, recovering, an assault, fortification, settlement.
* when Simple War ends with total dominance, the game will allow you to play even after total dominance, there is still story happening after total control.
* New Generals appear periodically. after 15 hours has passed since the last play session, new generals will appear if enabled to appear.
* Precursor Lords use diplomatically to ask for permission to enter enemy-controlled Domains.
* Pariah require Lums to become Precursors, discovering new lums takes a long time.
* All Precursor Lords pay the Tithe to Naya. Without Nayas support you will not be able to gain access to the heart of the world, or access to the libraries that allow you to create new technologies.
* Militia will join your army naturally.
* Precursor Lords you are friendly with might ask you to do things. Including attacking other Precursor Lords.
* Sometimes you'll face foes which are superior. You may need to use the environment, such as flooding an area to kill everyone in the province. This can be good to wipe out a superior force, but can result in sacrificing everything else in the province in the process, sometimes factions will be understanding that this was for the greater good.
* You can detach yourself from all neutral or tithe factions and do things entirely on your own, but it makes things far more difficult.
* you could flood the entire valley. why do that when you could send in a small force. Then it turns out the rebel force was actually the entire province and your small force is destroyed, their armor and lums used to bolster the enemy, should have flooded the valley when you had the chance.
* No matter what, a lot of good people are going to die, you can get around this by being more unconventional, such as negotiating with the enemy.
* Many artifacts are extremely powerful, Nayas units have a lot by default, some are clearly very dangerous, breaking these can lead to disaster for the location where the item was broken.
* "The sage reports that the barrier between the plane of Mar and the planes of exsitence feels thin and tested."
* You can stash artifacts in locations you construct, at first this will be simple caves, later it could even be within an enemy province, or give them directly to naya, or use them yourself with risk, your choice.
* Naya doesn't trust you and wants you to hand over all precursor artifacts you discover. You can lie to Naya and say you haven't discovered any.
* Each province has harvestable resources during a battle and outside of battle, these can be harvested and are finite, eventually running out entirely, you can upgrade your units/buildings by using finite resources as far as you can until those resources are expended. any troops you upgrade can carry over to the next province or remain within that province as a defender.
* A Sagedom can be formed by a General, their last name is the name of the Sagedom, for instance Sagedom of Wu, two factions may together form a Sagedom After this they may form a Kingdom in the same way.
* There are minor factions that hold individual towns, and these can be assimilated. These unique towns will produce their own units.
* a lesser faction approaches you early and asks if you want to trade for specialist armor and herbs; this will forever change your faction.
* There are factions which can provide you with powerful weapons and artifacts which are considered unconventional and dishonourable, using these will forever change your faction.
* pursuing and then killing a general that can barely fight can negatively affect honour.
* superior
* if you have no generals, lesser troops can still fight in combat and naturally elect a new general.
* inferior forces
* not a single man remains to carry our banner, it lies trampled in the dust.
* family tree where you can make people heirs, you can sign oaths so generals can join your family tree.
* if buying iron from another province, can impose tariff.
* a faction can actually birth a new faction, for instance a faction can discover a rusty droid and help them recover, and then that droid will become a leader and establish cities producing more droids.
* a faction that emerges after the old king was overthrown. the old king will approach and ask to join your army.
* A faction can discover a trait that makes an entire type of upgrades unobtainable for benefits elsewhere, or completely replacing key buildings or units so that the entire city is transformed.
* The first unit is a god which moulds singular individual units.
* Ruined buildings can be harvested from if repair isn't wanted.

* each song has a bad and a good version, which, when combined actually works well combined.
* Historical events will/can happen but can be bent or negated entirely, they aim to direct gameplay but can themselves be negated.

* Towns can form or be reconstructed by Leaders alone, or by working together.
* When a town is destroyed, the name of the town will show as "Remains of \[Name\]"
* Castes can encompass a maximum of one town, however, Castes may ally with or subsidise other Castes, degrading them from Castes to Chapters, and a Chapter can claim a town as a home.
* you can poison your own towns grain as a strategy if you know your city is going to fall to the enemy, or as a way to stop betrayal.
* Guilds will naturally form in your town based on what your town is good at. Negative guilds can exist within your town, and you may locate and eradicate these. Some guilds can spread across the world. Guilds are a form of business, and can often do unique things, such as training mercenaries.
* Entrepreneurs within towns establish their own businesses which export and import, businesses if they exist will automatically negotiate with other Entrepreneurs. They will open trade with other neutral or friendly towns, and will avoid unfriendly towns, towns must receive basic supplies, as well as trade goods and if access to items like food is restricted it can cause untold damage to your populace.
* Having access to luxury food items or rare items can do positive things like increase influence and motivation of your workers.
* Towns can defend exclusive right to nearby materials by constructing outposts, which are guarded by Cadres.
* Civ style town placement, with mount and blade style walk-through upgrading taking multiple days for construction, buildings are similar to Black and White II's but with small RTS style improvements given other buildings also exist.
* can unfound and purge towns.
* the max size of a town is dependent on several factors, but a town will usually only produce new novices if there are residences, supplies and employment, this is a matter of seeing unemployment, starvation etc and finding a balance.
* Towns may be influenced to integrate themselves into your own town, which is a quick and painless way to conquer cities.
* Towns can be raided, in the case this happens, neutral novices will become Militia and will defend the town, alongside any Cadres within the town. They will take from a pool of pre-existing stored armaments, if these exist.
* Towns may re-establish themselves after being eliminated by a Leader, this is if a number of previous residents, or influenced residents of other towns feel like the town once served a purpose such as it produced a resource. these towns become Merchant Cities and may provide benefits in exchange for coin.

## CASTES:\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Simple_War&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: CASTES:")\]

* Caste traits are one of the main ways to change you and your units appearance and mechanics in ways that are sample-able but limited outside of major faction support.
* You may conquer a Caste and gain access parts of their benefits, but full benefits can only be earned if defeated enemies are enslaved, and then teach your units.
* When a city is reconstructed or constructed from nothing, a faction forms. When a faction forms you will get a cinematic.
* The founding Leader becomes a Sage.
* Sages can form new Chapters.
* new Chapters will do what you ask of them, and can raise their own armies.
* you can assign a special type of Leader; called a Commandant, that will manage your Garrison and automate town tasks for you.
* Castes can become more unique over time, for instance a Caste may come across ancient precursor technology making them far stronger and have unique architecture and equipment, or may become immortal meaning their populace cannot die outside of combat.
* a Caste could discover the ability to manufacture Droids, meaning they can manufacture soldiers.
* a Caste could gain the ability to talk to wildlife, and form an alliance (such as control caves that can randomly produce allied units)
* most Castes will only ever achieve one of these things, and which is mostly dependent upon map placement.
* Castes can rise and fall literally overnight.

## MECHANICS\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Simple_War&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: MECHANICS")\]

* no sprawling tech trees or bullshit abilities like percentage increases.
* at max an army will be composed of around 80 soldiers, however this will be less.
* the game favors speed over graphical intensity or clutter.
* unlike a traditional stategy game of this type, the game works in real time and the game doesn't pause unless deliberately paused, there is plenty of downtime.
* the player doesn't constantly see everything other players are doing and don't need to watch them make their moves.
* the player doesn't need to immediately become a lord, or ever, they can play the game as a novice warrior or neutral in another leaders army and can even win the game like this. players may also form guilds and businesses.
* nothing is dumb, everything will automate and regulate themselves if you provide things you're supposed to provide on time, the only people that will ask for your advice are your lords and vassals.

## Diplomacy\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Simple_War&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Diplomacy")\]

* when doing diplomatic trades and agreements with other leaders, other leaders can demand things like the sword of your most famous troop. although an easy trade will damage your relationship with that troop and he may revolt and may take some men with him.

## NPCs\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Simple_War&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: NPCs")\]

* you can ally with neutral npcs that appear randomly on maps, such as a group of farmers if you save them, can do quests to convert neutrals permanently to your own side.
* some npcs may have some hidden interactions with the map itself. such as when approaching an area, will recall it from their memory and tell the player about what transpired there.
* you can take workers from your enemies, as well as getting a worker, they can build your enemies buildings and therefore units.
