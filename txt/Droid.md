Droids evolved in hopes to avoid the reliance upon Lums; due to the low availability of lums.
The first droids were once pariah, later droids were entirely mechanical, however often relied upon a Pariah's mind.
Droids greatly helped with the construction of the lum pipeline and the constuction of Hiraeth.

Droids were powered primarily by the light emitted by a lum, rather than the lum itself, meaning that the lum wasn't being exhausted in the process. This fact made Droid technolgy, especially orbs sought after by Precursors.

Lums were often housed in egg-shaped orbs, containing dozens of solar cells, which were used as batteries.
due to the scarcity of lums, orbs were rare used temporarily. most locations used systems where an orb would be given for another to be accessed. 

The orbs served as a protective shell, encasing the lum so that It could not be stolen.

Droids seemingly lost access to their own underground complexes due to Orbs being misplaced or stolen. 
Due to this many doors exist to lost Droid vaults.

Most droids were lost or destroyed. however, many parts existed and Droids could easily perform repairs on themselves, or even reactivate droids.
