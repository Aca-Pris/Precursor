Welcome to Precursor!

this is the first Devlog for Precursor
It has been in-dev for a while (since 2017)
and I'm just getting around to making something like this.

The game is being made in Godot. but by using .tres files
I should be able to make or edit items remotely from
Pulsar.

This is great If I want to do some game-dev in bed, or
on the go, which is the main intentions of having something
like this setup.
