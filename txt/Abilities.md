## Ideas

-   Abilities are Casting Time, Instant or Chanelled. 
-   By utilizing Haste it is possible to move this closer to Instant.
-   Haste condenses the total amount of time required for Channelled abilities to be fully cast
-   Abilities may also be passive. meaning that they are non-activatable. The opposite being Active abilities.
-   Active Abilities require Nim energies to cast. Meaning that ways to conserve or recover Nim energies are valuable.
-   Abilities can be earned/improved through the completion of content such as Temples, Quests, or Faction relations.

-   Nim energies will usually regen until 25 (or default). This is enough for a single jump or spell cast, but will drain beyond this amount.
-   It is possible to improve the default when Absorbing a Nim

-   basically with factions you're adding additional branches to your unique skill tree, but those branches are changed by your decisions, talents might be missing or appear, be entirely different, ordered differently, entire trees can change.
-   Door abilities are abilities that open doors to a whole tree of abilities, depending on how you wish to play, there are certain abilities, door abilities, you may wish to open or keep closed, when opened, this allows you to gain more abilities from that pool, which may not necessarily be something you want.
-   A healing class that can only heal using it's own health pool.
-   a sudden change during a quest can make changes to an entire factions skill tree permanently, changing abilities or replacing them, or removing them entirely.
-   put the player in situations where they don't have any abilities and make them feel that obtaining it is a reward rather than taken for granted.
-   abilities have cooldowns and those cooldowns can be reduced to zero through talents or stacking certain stats.
-   some items stats or even abilities may not make much sense at first, because they are dependent on talent choices reducing or modifying stats to act in new ways.
-   abilities you've been using for most of the game which you realise are powerful, but wrong and destructive and corrupting. and immediately stop using.


The player can select any nearby enemy with Z targeting.

Eco is not to dissimilar from traditional mana, in that it fuels abilities. However, Eco doesn't regenerate, and must be manually collected from vents (which can be discovered in dungeons using items such as bombs.) eco can also be stored for later consumption using bottles.

There are different types of Eco, Beneficial and Harmful.

Eco can be channeled through Items:

the Guantlet can do several things with Eco.

* Eco Ball. - large eco cost, slow cast time, deals a large amount of damage.
* Eco Shards - large eco cost, instant cast time, deals moderate damage when channeled.

the Rod can do several things with Eco.

* Eco Tap - Can absorb Eco from fallen enemies, alive allies.
* Eco Transfer - Can transfer eco to an ally, enemy.

the Guantlet can do several things with Eco.

* Eco Ball. - large eco cost, slow cast time, deals a large amount of damage.
* Eco Shards - large eco cost, instant cast time, deals moderate damage when channeled.

Other items, such as the Protector, can convert beneficial eco energies into a temporary Eco Shield, which dissipates when it takes a finite amount of damage.

Other items, such as the Precursor Blade can absorb nearby harmful sources of eco, allowing it to be used again offensively.

some creatures, such as the Plant have fixed attacks

Most enemies will keep a distance from a player while casting abilities they possess.

is it possible to have a zelda style combat system but with wow style abilities? or does it need to be one or the other?

i'd say it's better just to put the coolest abilities onto equipment pieces, having too many items would ruin the game.

I like the idea of an item starting damaged or as a prototype and then it is improved, and it's ability increases, but the improvement could be optional depending on what other abilities the player has.

if you're just getting random items from a dungeon, then that means dungeons cannot be designed around the player having obtained certain items,

what if the player gains both a fixed item from the big dungeon, but there are also smaller sub-dungeons for obtaining specific abilities.

you need to choose between accessing one dungeon out of several.

some dungeons require two abilities to even access them at all.
