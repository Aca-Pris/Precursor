The Dungeon is using an alternate source of power to remain functional, crystal resonance

The player has multiple choices they can make during the dungeon

Regarding the powersource:

Choice A) they choose to leave it alone, and so they can use the powersource later on for themselves or to power SecondTown only if SecondTown has no powersource.

Choice B) they choose to destroy it, and so nobody can benefit from the power.

  
The player will need to disable 3 locks, when they defeat each mini-boss, the shield protecting the inner portion (including the library) will fade.

after defeating the faction leader, the Prince, the player has a choice:

Choice A) purge the Library. selecting this option will mean that the faction will take control of the Library. Allowing the player immediate access to a Crystal weapon. Depending on the state of the powersource, the player can use the crystal weapon more or less effectively.

Choice B) let the Library continue their work. This option is only available if the powersource wasn't destroyed. letting the library continue creates the Remnants faction who are incredibly useful for the Smithing profession especially in regards to Precursor metal and weaponry They can make sense of lost knowledge that you find elsewhere in the world, and provide recipes no other faction can.
