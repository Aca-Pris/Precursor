Although it was known that Prae was ashamed with his creations. (namely, the disfunctional pariah)

Prae was less ashamed of those pariah who did seem capable of conquering their pangs.

Prae had elected the Sages. There were 5 Sages in total. Each sage would be granted a number of borrowed lums from the heart of the world

They were each also given a pearl. these pearls could change the coloration and effect of lum energies.  

and the Sages would be sent to the far reaches of Mar to establish their own Domains, and utilize their own pearls.

the Praelian Pearl was an iridescent pearl which contained aspects of all other lesser pearls

when energy was channeled through the praelian pearl, the energy temporarily seperated, during this process the different colors were distilled into pools, which were then used by Prae to create the lesser pearls.

the lesser pearls being.

The Blue pearl

the Green Pearl

the Yellow pearl

the red pearl.

and the dark pearl

although their initial power was unknown, the most powerful and influential was arguably the dark pearl, without which a lot of key discoveries wouldn't have been made.

The pearls were weak when seperated, the pearls were at their most powerful when used in combination with other pearls.

As such, the sages would often co-operate.

The Sages began preperations to establish their domains.

For a time, the sages had peacefully co-existed with Prae, and with eachother, some even establishing links back to the heart of the world

collaborating on projects, particularly surrounding creating diminuative forms of life such as trees, or grasses.

They had also sculpted the land as Prae did.

Some feats

Y - Red Sage - Naya

D - Dark Sage - Saro

G - Green Sage - Gor

  
\- D-Y-R, created Red fluid, which could be used to smelt metals.

\- D-G - created Chu's from red fluid.

\- D-Y-R, created precursor metal and orbs.

\- D-B-G -created Seeds and Acorns.

\- D-Y - discovered the ability to shape land.

\- G-B-R created blue fluid.

However, Prae had only granted them a small wealth of lums, they could not grow the number of lums that they each possessed.

The heart of the world held concentrated energies that did not reach their domains.

The power of the Dark pearl had caused conflict between Saro and Prae. Prae believing that it was, perhaps, too powerful.

Saro grew distant from Prae believing Prae wanted to limit the power of the Sages.

Naya and Saro two of the five sages felt that the energies of the heart of the world should be fairly distributed.

Prae however, refused to agree to terms for this.

and so, Both Naya and Saro led a charge against the heart.

The heart of the world was destroyed. and it's raw energy flooded the area and saturated all beings present.

Prae and Saro met face to face, and Saro attempted to use the power of the dark pearl to petrify Prae.

However, Prae reversed this fate upon Saro, who was then petrified, and the dark pearl was then shattered.

Upon seeing this, Saro's forces began to retreat.

Prae was in the belief that he threw several beings from existence itself, including several of Saro's generals

This had been a key mistake of Prae. The beings \*had not\* fallen from existence entirely

they had instead found themselves on lower planes of Mar, many of whom still posessed the lums they had stolen.

It is thought that these beings on the lower planes had constructed cities such as Hiraeth, and had established the lum pipeline.

Due to the time differences on the lower planes, many of them immediately re-appeared through a door, equiped with crafted technology.

observing this, this is when Prae created the Petrifach.

The main goal of the petrifach was to petrify the opponents so that they could not re-appear on lower planes.

Using lum energies, Prae created a metal known as Adamantine.

The only thing that could pass through this material was lum energy itself.

the intention was to use this metal to create permanently sealed doors to seal the planes.

Before sealing the planes, Prae sent through many Petrifach. their goal being the recovery of stolen lums to transfer through the adamantine.

It is thought that the lower planes had been mostly starved of lums. causing life on the lower planes to later become diminuative.   

If any of Saro's generals had survived the initial and subsequent conflicts, they would become weaker as more lum energies were recovered.

  
most of his faction that remained on the upper plane was anhiliated during this conflict; the heart of the world was destroyed and the energies of the heart were stolen mostly by Naya's faction

Some of Saro's faction survived, gaining many lums, but relinquished their allies and abandoned the conflict, leaving to form their own factions.

In Naya's mind keeping them contained meant that Mar would remain small.

The heart of the world was discussed.
