I'm coming to the realization that I could probably create .tres files for my Entities too?
- of course it'd not be the exact same.
- They will also have an icon portrait that I should be putting in the .kra file.
- they could have a description if right clicked
- having a default sound for entity selection is kinda the main thing I'd like from this.

I think first I should start with an Entity.tres file and give it some defaults and future Entities can extend from that.
