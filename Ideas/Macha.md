# Macha
Macha is known as a figment
or in other words, a mortal who is a reincarnation of an immortal precursor.
Macha suffered from amnesia and wants to reconnect with her immortal self.
so that she can be granted the powers of her immortal self.

She wishes to restart a cycle which has been broken by beings like Naya.
who wish to prevent Macha from being able to effectively restart the world anew.
