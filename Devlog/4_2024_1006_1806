today I've been working on the 3D mouse
here's what I'd like it to achieve

the player should be able to pick up the capsule, and fill it with blue energy using the 3D hand/mouse.
they should then be able to pick up a tree, and this will drain half of the capsule, and maintaining the hold of the tree will drain the second half.
the goal is to bring the tree to the chipper, and that will convert it into logs,
the logs can be burned for another source of blue energy, but capsules have to remain in the machine for it to retain energy.

one of the first areas, the player can find the sculptor, allowing them to convert blue energy and clay into minions.
the minions can be use to cut down trees for example, instead of the player manually having to pick up the trees.
this results in the creation of additional minions.
