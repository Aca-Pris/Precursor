**Precursor Boots** have several main purposes: allowing the user to walk across incredibly hot ground, activate rusted switches, sink beneath water or deflect winds. They are worn primarily by **Nayan Guard**.

Although a Precursor can wear these boots with relative ease, a Pariah would struggle to walk in these boots until they consumed additional lums.

_Forged by mysterious hands, these boots allow the wearer to march across hot ground._
