## Ideas


Alchemy is unlocked when the player obtains the Bottle during the Soup quest early into the game, which will allow them to do things like gather water; which is a main base for alchemy.

For the beginning poriton of the game, the player will start with soups, and then upon discovering ingredients with different properties, will begin to instead create potions.

Ingredients can be collected from various locations. Some ingredients are so rare that they can only be collected within 
a specific location. such as the boiling springwater found in the underground shrine. 


Most potions, including Soups will contain 3 doses before being entirely used.

Some ingredients require specific preperation. 
A sliced root might have an effect, but a powdered root will not.
Basic Alchemy equipment includes the Mortar and Pestle and the Knife
An incorrectly prepared ingredient can change the effect of the final potion.



In order to perform alchemy, the player will firstly require a recipe. Recipes come in three types. Basic Brewed and Distilled

Brewed potions require higher quality herbs, and the Brewing Process Distilled potions require the highest quality herbs and the distilation process.

Brewing Brewed items are produced in bulk, in a vat. The potion will take several real-world days to fully mature The Brewing process will either result in the potions failing to be created, the desired Brewed potions being created or extremely rarely, with the addition of Secret Ingredients the potion can be greatly modified.

Distilation Brewed Potions can be distilled using an Alembic. Distilation multiplies the effectiveness of the final potions, distilled ingredients can also be created.

  

Some potions, such as Bitters, will require additional unique steps, such as freezing the vat and extracting the unfrozen liquid.

  

-   Instead of receiving identifiable herbs from unknown plants, unskilled players obtain plant parts, plant parts can be used to make unskilled potions, depending on which specific plant parts were used, yields different resembling effects.
-   although potions are hard to produce and rare, their effects stack.
