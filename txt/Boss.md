## Bosses
Bosses are encountered by the Player, and then defeated.

## Ideas:
* bosses have static death positions, meaning they will be there and remain dead for the rest of the game.
* choice to reinstate a boss.

* the last boss is the easiest boss in the game, and is intended to make you reconsider if what you're doing is really just.
* some bosses drops a component not found anywhere else in the game.
* a boss that gets stronger the more players that defeat it.
* the boss gets stronger the more time that you take to get there.
* it is clear that the boss of the area has learned how to use one of the features of the surrounding wildlife. (levitation) and is now using this trick as his own
* The boss mob appears in the world and is unkillable, then the next time you see him he is.
* a boss that gets stronger the more players that defeat it. the player is told their number upon killing the boss.
* a boss you track over the course of the game. he seems unreachable and unkillable. he almost dies to environmental damage. but ultimately falls to you
* a secret concerning an npcs true allegiance is revealed after the boss is defeated in the boss area.
* a character powerful enough to be a boss, and although can be destroyed, is neutral and there is no need to do this.
* your power source is entirely gone and non-functional within that place, so you must steal it from elsewhere, including the boss. 

## The Lone\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Boss&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: The Lone")\]

have a boss that when it dies it's influence on the surrounding area ends.

## general of the right.\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Boss&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: general of the right.")\]

<sup>The leader of Nayas remainder forces (post-naya)</sup>

the boss is guarding rooms containing items of great importance, so the boss is more there to guard these things.

## Naya\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Boss&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Naya")\]

<sup>main bad guy</sup>

* you fight the enemy in his weakened form first, defeating him, but then later, you face him without him being weakened.
* a collectable currency. boss is slowly responsible for removing some that currency from the game, (total number keeps decreasing, can decrease to 0 under worst conditions.)
* during the boss fight you actually get weaker, as you sacrifice your power permanently to defeat him.
* A character that is defeated then has all of his lums drained by Naya, Naya becomes far stronger and visually changes, before Naya can leave, the character stands up to fight him for a second time and wins. destroying Naya.

##  waterfall guardian

the waterfall guardian is presumably a nayan guard instructed by Naya to guard the entrance to the waterfall
this is due to the blue pearl being used to generate the stream of blue eco. 
they are automatically hostile to all who approach

the blue pearl was created by prae using lums, and is an extremely powerful artifact.
the blue pearl was orginally held by Ora Kas, and was later stolen by the droids, who used it to generate blue eco.

Although some have been using the stream, including the player, this has been purposefully done. 
the actual intention is to flood the lakebed structure downstream, thus preventing it from being accessed, or used to reactivate the pipeline project.

the lakebed structure is actually the pipeline project created by the Droids. 

it is being purposefully flooded to prevent eco access to NorthTown and EastTown, which both are suffering from droughts of blue eco.
it comprises of an underground network of tunnels that in a working condition could direct eco to these locations.
