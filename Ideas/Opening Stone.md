The Opening Stone is given to the player as a quest reward. It is a one-time-use item that can be used to unlock any door in the game immediately. The game expects you to use immediately, if you save it for later, it's far more valuable.

After the first fight with Naya, he will escape through a precursor door which he seals. the Opening Stone will allow the player to follow Naya instantaneously and reach a new area far sooner than expected. Naya becomes far easier and some otherwise inaccessible quests become accessible.

It is unknown if the Opening Stone can unlock the Sealed Room.
