Had some time off work this week so I decided to get around to working on the
text side of the project.

I guess the main issue is I just need a text editor that can be used on one
monitor and fullscreened. and I think Pulsar is probably the solution to This
zettlr is fine - it just doesn't have the interconnectivity of pulsar.

pulsar also doubles as an actual code editor that recognises gdscript, so thats
also not bad.

you might see some references to miraheze, it was the DB i used to host This
before i made it local. miraheze is kinda meant for group stuff.
