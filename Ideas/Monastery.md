Thought to be rebuilt from the reclaimed stone at the bottom of the world, the monastery now looms far over the world, subjecting all to it's intimidating gaze.

Monastery patrols can be spotted in the world after leaving [InitialTown](https://nim.miraheze.org/wiki/InitialTown "InitialTown")

Intended to be a faithful rebuilding of the ancient shrine at the bottom of the world, the monastery in time became far more.

Controlled by the jingoistic monastery guard.

Those within the monastery lived in their own world, inducting the strong into insurmountable beings.

The Monastery leases areas in Hiraeth, and controls Hiraeth. If factions wish to be on a peaceful communal terms with the monastery, they must lease from Hiraeth.

## Gameplay\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Monastery&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Gameplay")\]

The monastery can be accessed from an early point in the game if the player comes in contact with a Precursor Guard, who may either kill or knock out the player. If the player is knocked out, they will appear in the Monastery, and will be forced to progress in the Monastery before being released several acts later.

Whilst in the monastery, much of the outside world and game changes around the player, and the player can eventually become a general of [Naya](https://nim.miraheze.org/wiki/Naya "Naya").
