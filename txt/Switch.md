Switches appear in many forms and locations. Effects of activating them include:

* Opening doors
* Making Chests appear
* Moving walls or other obstacles
* Opening gates to fill areas with water, or drain them
* Opening skylights to allow Light Beams inside

Once activated, a Switch's effect may or may not be permanent:

* **Permanent:** The Switch's action remains in effect indefinitely, or at least until the player leaves the room, which triggers many puzzles in the series to reset.
* **Timed:** The Switch's action only lasts for a short duration, usually with a musical cue or ticking clock sound effect to indicate this.
* **Momentary:** Only applies to floor Switches. Will stay activated as long as something is on top of it to hold it down, otherwise it will immediately deactivate when something gets off the Switch.

## Types of Switches\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Switch&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Types of Switches")\]

### Eye Switch\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Switch&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Eye Switch")\]

_Main article: Eye Switch_

  
An Eyeball Switch is a wall Switch that looks like an open eye. When hit by an Arrow (or a Slingshot nut), the eye closes and is activated. Some of these Eyeball Switches are encased in ice, which must be unfrozen using a certain ability.

### Floor Switch\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Switch&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Floor Switch")\]

_Main article: Floor Switch_

**Floor Switches** normally take the form of a large button or plate, which can be activated by being stepped on by the player, or sometimes by placing a heavy object on top.

### Grapple Switch\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Switch&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Grapple Switch")\]

A **Grapple Switch** is a ceiling-mounted variation on the pull lever which is activated by the player hanging from it, either by its handle or by using the Clawshot/Grappling Hook. Sometimes they require the player to wear the Iron Boots for extra weight.

### Lever\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Switch&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Lever")\]

_Main article: Lever_

**Levers** are a variation on the mechanical switch that are recessed into walls. Link must pull on a handle to activate it. These Levers are frequently timed or booby trapped.

### Light Switch\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Switch&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Light Switch")\]

_Main article: Light Switch_

**Light Switches** are hand-activated levers that perform some function when pushed into a different position. They appear in both _A Link to the Past_ and _The Minish Cap_.

### Shock Switch\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Switch&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Shock Switch")\]

_Main article: Shock Switch_

**Shock Switches** are small sphere- or obelisk-shaped Switches that can be activated by being slashed by a sword or hit by another weapon.

### Sun Pattern\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Switch&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Sun Pattern")\]

A **Sun Pattern** is activated by having Light Beam shone at it, usually by rotating a mirror or by using the Mirror Shield. When activated, they sometimes evaporate. Like Pull Levers, they can sometimes be trapped.

### Torch Switch\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Switch&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Torch Switch")\]

_Main article: Torchlight_

**Torchlights** are sometimes used as disguised switches, which are activated by lighting them. Torch switches are frequently timed, their effects lasting only until the flame goes out. When multiple torches are present, Link will usually have to light them all before the first one goes out to trigger the effect. This is much easier with area-effect spells such as Din's Fire, or at least long-range methods like a Fire Arrow.

### Wind Switch\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Switch&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Wind Switch")\]

_Main article: Wind Switch_

**Wind Switches** can be activated by blowing them with Wind, causing them to rotate.
