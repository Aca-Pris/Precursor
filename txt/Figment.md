# Figments

Figments are the combined personality, knowledge and experience of an immortal precursor. 
Figments are capable of retaining experience and knowledge that can be reclaimed by the immortal precursor at the end of the figments lifespan.

This process in the past has been cyclical, with an immortal precursor reclaiming the memories and experiences, and effecively restarting Mar anew. 

Beings such as Macha want to fully rejoin with their immortal selves to bring about this time of remaking.
other beings such as Naya want to fully prevent the cycle.
