## Rules:

* bosses have static death positions, meaning they will be there and remain dead for the rest of the game.
* choice to reinstate a boss.

* the last boss is the easiest boss in the game, and is intended to make you reconsider if what you're doing is really just.
* some bosses drops a component not found anywhere else in the game.

## Ideas:

* a boss that gets stronger the more players that defeat it.
* the boss gets stronger the more time that you take to get there.
* The boss mob appears in the world and is unkillable, then the next time you see him he is.
* a boss that gets stronger the more players that defeat it. the player is told their number upon killing the boss.
* a boss you track over the course of the game. he seems unreachable and unkillable. he almost dies to environmental damage. but ultimately falls to you
* a secret concerning an npcs true allegiance is revealed after the boss is defeated in the boss area.
* a character powerful enough to be a boss, and although can be destroyed, is neutral and there is no need to do this.

## The Lone

have a boss that when it dies it's influence on the surrounding area ends.

## general of the right

The leader of Nayas remainder forces (post-naya)

the boss is guarding rooms containing items of great importance, so the boss is more there to guard these things.

## Naya


* you fight the enemy in his weakened form first, defeating him, but then later, you face him without him being weakened.
* a collectable currency. boss is slowly responsible for removing some that currency from the game, (total number keeps decreasing, can decrease to 0 under worst conditions.)
* during the boss fight you actually get weaker, as you sacrifice your power permanently to defeat him.
* A character that is defeated then has all of his lums drained by Naya, Naya becomes far stronger and visually changes, before Naya can leave, the character stands up to fight him for a second time and wins. destroying Naya.
