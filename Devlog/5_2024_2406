Long time no work!

been busy at work these last few weeks, but I've still been thinking about the project.

I think I may include the Zettlr files. so those will be uploaded alongside This, this just allows me to also work on the Zettlr stuff on the go
and that stuff is mostly just text files anyways.

[edit 1]
So the idea is, if I edit something over in Zettlr,
it should also update here, and if I push it, I should then be able to edit it from anywhere

[edit 2]
made a test file over in zettlr, and it updated here. great.

[edit 3]
still don't see any real point of putting the .kra file on here.

[edit 4]
in terms of my recent thoughts, I definetely want the game to start on a set of floating islands, with the first dungeon being a cave, and the second being
a tower that descends lower.

i do want the player to interact with water physics
i did get the 3D mouse working as I intended/wanted. it lacks all of the functionality, but it does exist now.

robots definetely should have detachable parts/rope bridges/sever points, etc.

I really need to work on integrating loose txt files into the zettlr.

[edit 5]

I honestly may just abandon zettlr? as I never use it. I was looking for an offline DB solution like Obsidian, but Obsidian costs money.

Also I might just abandon the time convention on these devlogs moving forwards, since it's just my thoughts on a specific date regardless of time
