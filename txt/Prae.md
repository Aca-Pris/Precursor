Prae consumed lums until he no longer experienced sleep cycles. whilst awake had vivid dreams and nightmares.

He dreamt of monotonous plains and impetuous rivers. So he would create beings of incredible strength, these initially proved useful in carving out the landscape, to fold hills into the monotonous plains and to deviate the too-impetuous rivers. Prae sculpted each of the great plains. displeased with the size of the land given to him, he gathered land from other locations, folding each plain thousands of times until he considered each complete, then rested in the dreamless and tranquil land.

tearing lums from his being and sacrificing his immortality he reached into the earth and cultivated life. his initial creations were nightmarish and ill eventually, he had somewhat succeeded. These imperfect beings he brought into existence were named the pariah. The Pariah were far weaker than Prae, to remedy this, and expending much of his lums, Prae created the "heart" which would slowly feed energies into the basin.

Prae allowed the pariah to roam the basin, claiming their mortal territories and consuming latent lum energies For a time, things were peaceful, and Prae had elected sages to oversee each domain. He forged pearls from lums, each containing a fragment of his own power. The sages would work together, making scientific discoveries, and work on infrastructure projects.

This was when the Pariah would establish areas such as Hiraeth. Some domains were too far from the heart to benefit from it - many sages believed the pipeline project would remedy this Prae instead proposed that the world slept, awaking in a later time, when lums would be more plentiful due to the heart. the Sages that were loyal to Prae agreed to this, willingly undergoing a process called Petrifaction, becoming statues, still adorned in their equipment.

following petrifaction, the world slept for 234 years. Hiraeth, and many other settlements fell into disrepair, or became entirely buried in the interim. two sages had woken up from Petrifaction earlier than had been agreed. they entered the heart of the world. They fought with horrific savagery and shattered the heart. Shortly after their phyrric victory, Prae used what little remained of his lums to form immortal defenders known as the petrifach. Ultimately, Prae and the Petrifach were successful in restoring the heart, and both of the sages were destroyed.

Prae had sacrificed much, degrading too far. he had to sleep nearby the heart to recover his energies. The petrifaction continued, if greatly marred due to these events.

Prae's usage of the word Marred led to the world eventually being known as Mar. Sometime before the battle, several pariah had, by chance, chosen not to participate in the conflict, and had become sole heirs of Mar during the petrifaction, These survivors dispersed, and formed new domains, leading to the creation of Droids,

Prae viewed the Petrifach as an unnecessary consequence upon his world. however, due to them, he and the heart would be kept safe, as the others still slept, unknowing of the events which had taken place.

  

In time, what remained of the creator resided within the shell of his mind, only coming out briefly as flashes of brilliance and fevered nightmares. Prae existed only to document his dreams and nightmares within a vegetative state protected by his undying Petrifach. one day the fire would fade, and the pariah would inherit the world, his world.
