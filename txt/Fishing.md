When it is first obtained, the Rod contains a Precursor Metal Hook, which is easily overlooked as being a source of Precursor metal which can be melted down.

With the fishing profession, the player is able to use a variety of hooks, lures and baits to catch fish. Fish can be used with the alchemy profession in soup preperation.

Fish randomly spawn in water and cannot be targeted. If you get too close you will despawn the fish. fish can be identified mostly by color alone you need to cast near the fish, and then the fish might examine the lure. Fish have various sizes, larger fish require stronger lines. the best fish require a specific lure, bait and hook to be caught - and this information might not be readily available.

Lures: Floating - most basic lure. Sinking lure - obtained later.
