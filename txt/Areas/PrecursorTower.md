# The Precursor Tower


The Precursor Tower is the first dungeon the player encounters in the game, located in the Desert. It is a large, deactivated power-router capable of sending energies elsewhere.

After unblocking and then scaling the Waterfall, by using the Empty Bottle with the source, the player is able to collect a source of eco. they can use this to water the dried bomb-plants, accessing additional sources of eco, and unlocking the route to the tower.

The player will find various switches they can press to gain access to additional eco and additional outdoor puzzles en-route to the tower. Eventually, after reaching and reactivating the door, the player will be inside the external wall of the tower, which they will begin to climb externally.

upon reaching the apex of the tower, the player will then descend into the depths. The depths itself is largely eco-themed, and has large quantities of eco, the puzzles will start mostly lacking eco, but as the player begins to solve puzzles, eco will begin to appear as part of puzzles.

It is here that the player will discover the Eco pipeline.

the reason the player is here is to basically reset and restart the tower.

buttons need to pressed using weight, either from the player or surrounding objects.

time-based jumping puzzles powered by blue eco.

## Directing the Flow

The player has a moral choice, the people wanted the player to redivert the flow to SecondTown (A town which they currently have no contact with) or the player can instead help the Wounded Precursor, who is a Monastery Guard and part of the Nayan Protectorate.

Option A) Helping the wounded precursor means that when the player reaches the monastery they will be treated as an ally rather than a prisoner. If the player helps the Wounded Precursor, the flow is Diverted to Hiraeth, which Naya uses to continue digging operations there. meaning 10% more of Hiraeth is uncovered.

Option B) they can defeat the wounded precursor, retrieve his precursor equipment, and divert the flow to SecondTown.

No matter the players decision, they will gain the Conduit.

If the player changes their mind before they leave, they can attack the wounded Precursor at any time to start the encounter. If they however leave the tower, they can return to the tower at any time to redivert the flow, but this will prevent them from getting the Monastery event.

Diverting the Flow to SecondTown means that a lot of quests become available there.

Within 10 days of gametime (if letting the precursor live), the Precursor will have called in allies and is now a significantly harder fight.

When talking about Rooms, this is always true:

W = up

S = down

A = left

D = right.

C = center

Room 1

from W to S there is a fallen wood bridge.

the part at W isn't climable/accessible.

the part at S can be climbed like vines

close to part S, up the vines are several dried-out-bomb-plants.

at C there is a rock surrounded by a circular-water-pond.

After being given a empty-bottle.

The bottle can be swiped at the circular-water-pond

obtaining bottle-of-water

which can be used on the dried-out-bomb plants.

the bomb can be thrown at the rock.

this causes a geyser to appear at C

The water level rises.

Allowing W to now be accessed.

Room 2:

There are 3 blocks from A to D

block closest to A must be grabbed towards S

freeing the one closest to C

which must be grabbed towards A

A tunnel is behind the C block

Room 3:

room 4:

before the player can climb the ladder, they are targetted by the Chu

room 9:

room 11:

the ropes on the rope bridge can be burned, causing it to fall

room 12:

the ropes on the hanging platform can be sliced, causing it to fall

room 13:
