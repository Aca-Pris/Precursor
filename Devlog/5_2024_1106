I think the game should start on a sky-island

the reason for the sky-island is because it's better than having a sea of
blue energy that wouldn't make much sense for the plot.

the player discovers the inactive precursor lab. with an inactive vent.
and a small cavern that leads to a solid and impassible adamantine door.


there are some optional things to do before the cavern that result in orbs, or
future growables.


The player discovers the adamantine statue at the end of the cavern who gives
them the capsule.

the statue tells the player that deeper into the mine is a pool of blue energy
and they can absorb this energy into the capsule.
this pool has a maximum of three uses before it dries up.
meaning the players can have 3 capsules-worth of blue energy.

the statue informs the player that if they return with a capsule of blue energy
the statue can open a portal to the dry world to look for the bomb plant seeds
this is required to go deeper into the mine.
