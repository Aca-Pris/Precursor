When Naya pursued Amari only to tell him that he would've always lost, Naya was broken. The speech he gave wasn’t for Amari's benefit. It wasn’t to help him defeat who he had become at all. It was destructive, sociopathic, and utterly hopeless.

It was Naya's way of deciding that the world is fundamentally unfair, that victory is all that matters.

It’s in this moment he decides that yes, Nau was right about him, in fact, he was right about everything.

Naya had given up in that moment. He won’t show anyone that he can be better than the being that created him.Instead, He’ll just show people that Nau was always right.

Defeated, angry, bitter, Naya feels anguish. He can never win against the shadow of Nau. So why fight it?

Later, in the same room where he once destroyed Nau, he returns to that same place where now winning is the only thing that matters.. He fulfilled the prophecy that Nau made, “Sometimes, a god can become so lost that they lose themselves entirely”

The only way he can win is to lose, to just give in, to become the assessment Naya believed he was inside. 

He may never quite realize how twisted Naya was in his final moments, how his lie would fundamentally disprove this.  

They shared the same flaw, that winning an argument mattered. it was the most important thing in the world.

Those tears are him dying inside, and letting this other person take over. He has fully lost his mind, and himself, and in that twisted up self-loathing and grief is left this other personality he can wear, his idea of a winner, a fun-house mirror version of himself.
