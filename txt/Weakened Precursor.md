Phase 1:

The more Eco the boss is able to obtain during the encounter, the more abilities he is able to use.

During the damage phase, the boss will spend his accumulated eco, and then return to Eco collection afterwards.

Phase 2:

In phase 2, the Precursor will become desperate and periodically perform a Lum Explosion, dealing damage to himself. when this happens, the player must hide behind an object in the room to avoid taking damage.

## Hard Mode\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Weakened_Precursor&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Hard Mode")\]

If the player discovered the Precursor Orb prior to the fight, they can unlock the optional hard mode by inserting the orb into the Eco Pump during the fight, this greatly increases the total eco that the boss has access to during the encounter, with this eco, the boss will destroy the rock wall during the encounter, and thus unlock the bosses third phase.
