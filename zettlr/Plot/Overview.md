the particular world they are in is a coastal area with a few shacks.
the music is happy and uplifting
the other characters will state that they know that this is not the only world and they wonder what other worlds exist
but there is a deep, and silent cave.
at the end of the cave is an adamantium statue. 


-   Prae creates the Pariah

-   due to being shattered by the Singing Sword, The Pearls had inadvertantly been made into objects which would teleport the user to the past.

  

## Act 1

when the game begins, the player character is a normal blank canvas who has no awareness of the events that are unfolding around them. They have no energies and are a Pariah. From a friendly Precursor, They are given a single Nim. They can use this Nim to navigate StarterCavern solving simple puzzles. They will come across things such as Copper and unsolvable puzzles which cannot be solved until later. Upon leaving StarterCavern, the player arrives in InitialTown and meets the Sage. The main quest focuses on unblocking the waterfall in CliffsideCaves allowing energies to flow again.

by completing the DeliciousSoup quest you gain access to the Bottle, which is needed to take energies from the Pool this will allow the player to unlock the path to the PrecursorTower, completing a series of puzzles to do so. Inside the PrecursorTower the player will once again meet the Precursor. The player may choose to direct the newfound power from PrecursorTower to Hiraeth or to SecondTown. If the player chooses SecondTown then they must fight the Precursor.

During this same time, Proa has foresight that Macha will defeat him atop the Monastery. And in knowing so, sends Ly back to the past by destroing his part of the Dark Pearl This is an event which is observed in the far distance as a beam of light is shot into the sky signifying Proa's death Observing this beam of light at Hiraeth, Naya shatters his part of the Dark Pearl, also returning to the past.

the player returns to InitialTown, the world is now Dark, despite it being day. The town is empty, and the only thing that remains is the Green Pearl glowing in the Sage's hut. upon touching the pearl, the player will similarly be teleported to the past.

  

## Act 2

After arriving, the player will be confused. they will be in a large, metropolitan-esque city and will assume they have travelled to the future. All they have awareness of is Prae, Naya and the Sage.

  

  

Not long after this, those same Precursor warriors including Ly, invade InitialTown demanding the Pearl from the sage. The sage gives up the pearl and shortly afterwards is slain by Naya's general. the player meanwhile is able to escape to the Dark World. When the player initially reaches the Dark World they have no prior knowledge of it, and are unable to determine if it is the future or the past. The player will however assume that they are in the future given the metropolitan nature of Mar.

During the Dark world, the player learns that Naya possesses the pearl. and then believes that they have travelled to a hopeless future where Naya has won. all evidence points to this. it is however later revealed that they are actually in the past. that Naya was the original owner of the pearl, and that the Sage came into possession of the pearl by taking it from Naya. The players goal becomes undermining Naya's influence in both the LightWorld and DarkWorld.

The Pearl originally was owned by Naya, and he was given it by Prae, Naya then used the pearl to create his failed worlds, one of those worlds just so happened to be Mar.

The pocket watch in _12 Minutes_ was the wife’s father’s back when he was still alive, but, as revealed by the cop in subsequent loops, the wife supposedly murdered her father due to his abusive behavior. Eventually, the player is able to prove the wife’s innocence after discovering that her father wasn’t killed in the initial shooting, but several days after in another shooting. The realization of who actually killed the father begins dawning on the player after discovering that the father had an affair with a woman named Dahlia, who happens to be the player character’s mother.

It’s revealed that Dahlia’s son, _12 Minutes_’ protagonist, was the one who killed the wife’s father. What’s more, as the wife’s father is also the player character’s father, the couple realizes that they’re half-siblings in a horrid twist of fates. The player character, voiced by James McAvoy, reveals that he’s repressed the memory of murdering his own father which is why he had never brought it up to his wife. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, the wife is pregnant with the player’s child, bringing some major ethical questions into play.

The wife reveals that her mother always called the father’s bastard son “monster,” which were her father’s dying words spoken to the cop who enters the apartment every loop. The cop and the father were very close, which is why he feels entitled to the pocket watch that remains hidden by the wife, but upon realizing that the “monster” the father was referring to in his final moments was the player, he decides to take different actions.

After the dust settles of the main events of _12 Minutes_, it’s clear that the player character had much more relation to the central conflict than he was initially letting on. When the twist hits revealing that he’s related by blood to his pregnant wife, he transforms from an every-man relatable protagonist to someone more heinous and definitely much less relatable.

## Timeline\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Lore&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Timeline")\]

### Mar\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Lore&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Mar")\]

* In the beginning, the world was dormant.
* Mar had no water table and had a weakened atmosphere.
* An uncultivated blank canvas.
* some ice scattered, permafrost glaciers existed from the remains of comets
* the sun began to burn the debris which had orbited it, slowly leaking slithers of light onto the world below.
* somewhere within that ice, aen, known as originator ampoules .
* glacial waters began to fill the basin, flowing to the undisturbed caverns.
* kao had diluted in the flow. staining, becoming blue kao, becoming motion.
* glaciers themselves sculpted new passes through the foothills.
* massive torrents of Kao infused waters.
* as the water table replenished, so too did the emergent sea, and the great salt desert was swept beneath it.
* The oceanic currents could not be predicted or monitored.
* during the height of day, boiling rivers would sculpt the land where the glaciers once began.
* blue kao seeped onto the dry land, and became green kao, the energy of life
* the green kao returned to the ocean, mixing made cyan.
* curiously, blue kao had all been erased as fast as it had been created, only small puddles remained in caverns.
* life appeared in the emergent sea, it soon became a warm saline ocean teeming with life.
* the cyan energies entering the land slowly became green
* every morning, the beginnings of plains were covered with a film of dew.

### Exodus\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Lore&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Exodus")\]

* Sometime after the world had been formed, it remained absent.
* cyan energies had been the most prevalent.
* following some natural chemistry however, other types of energy had emerged.
* a font of purest kao had been naturally reformed
* and seeped into crystal which produced song.
* Within the Pillar of Song a being had been formed of crystal and kao.
* whilst awake the being had vivid dreams and nightmares which it could document and recall instantaneously, and bring into existence.
* taking pity on the fate of the world, he sacrificed what little remained of his lums to reach into the land and cultivate new life.
* he created several progenitor creatures. the first of which were nightmarish and ill, only capable of stealing the dreams of others and never forging destinies of their own.
* He was disheartened by his initial failings.
* Later, he would create beings of incredible strength. these initially proved useful in carving out the landscape, to fold hills into the monotonous plains and to deviate the too-impetuous rivers.
* He finished his creative efforts by conceiving the pariah, by far his weakest creation.
* He sculpted the cave of bad dreams, where he could store his worst thoughts.
* after these monumental processes had concluded; the creator degraded to a mere precursor.
* His Pariah were broken creatures that struggled to deal with their own emotions and flesh.
* the seas above were riven by such extreme tsunamis that many of the pariah perished due to natural conditions such as wind and rain.

* The pariah that remained slowly conquered their constant pain, and climbed from the basin.
* diminutive fruits grew near the small pools.
* The pariah picked these fruits until their fingers were purple and prickled.
* They would begin to discover their resplendent homeland, scattering to all corners of the world.
* the emergent sea had areas with little salt-content at this time, and the pariah soon drank from its waters.
* Pariah meet and befriend others in the tranquil southern grasslands.
* The heart of the world was discovered and it's energies are siphoned into the few, causing the heart to be diminished.
* Those that siphoned the heart became known as the precursors. who adorned plates of bronze and were now near immortal.
* the tea trees soaked in the sun, sometimes, during hot-floods the leaves would brew tea in the flood-water
* In the great valley to the south, younger trees sprouted, and a river of tea flowed by.

* Pariah begin working with wood and later stone.
* The first fruits are being spliced and cultivated, becoming distinct.
* lums are being transferred from other Pariah; who begin to understand the link between lums and all life.
* It becomes apparent that lums affect their general appearance and capabilities.
* Many lums were lost as pariah ventured and perished in the cavernous depths.
* Not many wished to relinquish their stolen lums.

## Pacification\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Lore&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Pacification")\]

* After the destruction of the heart and the subsequent lethargy that overcame the Precursors and lesser pariah, the Conservator, Naya, began construction of the towers that you see littering the landscape.
* The Conservator plotted to imprison a being of immense power behind a grand force field. The towers would channel latent lum energies into the shield, keeping it operational. While imprisoned, Nau would serve as a battery to the populace.
* The siphoned energies would sustain the Precursors, allowing those within to feed their endless and growing magical pangs. Thousands of years passed and the power required to keep Nau imprisoned while sustaining life began to shift. The cost to keep Nau bound grew to overshadow the rate at which energy could be siphoned and distributed. The once net gain turned to loss
* The Precursors were slain, not by invading armies, but by the Naya himself.
* The people were destroyed in order to preserve the Conservators immortal life and near limitless powers. The power once divided among thousands now funnels into the conservator and his warriors. Those few remaining survivors were directly feeding power into the towers in order to keep Nau imprisoned. The demon broke free of its bonds and destroyed what little was left of the once great bastion.
* With the heart diminished, all that it had once created begins to fade.
* Many conclude that the time of the heart had ended. they would take what remained and continue without the heart.
* The heart, which was in its final death throes long before the player was even born, received its end with the siphoning of whatever remained of it's energies.
* The creator, using what little remained of his creative vision creates a sword capable of petrifying those coveting lums.
* Using the sword, the first hero uses it to petrify the warriors, and harvest the lums.
* The creator and the hero travel to the bottom of the world, an underground sea overlain with a thick fog.
* The hero tosses the sword into the sea.
* The creator tells the Hero that the lums sealed within the blade could never harm the world again, unless the blade was rediscovered.
* His desperate action of discarding the lums, which had only succeeded in

* others became aware of the distant tales of the Warrior and the presumed slaying of the creator.
* Many explore In the maze-like canyon networks of the equator, a group of pariah discovered a hollowed volcano.
* Many pariah disagreed with these actions; citing that they could have learned much from such a being, others are content that the power was divided amongst the precursors.
* Hiryu and Naya travel to the mountains, where Hiryu carves out a monastery from the stone, forming a Dais.
* Pariah began replanting stretches of tea trees, and forming areas such as the Crownlands, located on the mesa in the central valley.

* Pariah establish independent domains mostly in high peaks and airtight caves, or far into the desert.
* The pariah continue foraging and documenting the herbs, fruits and wildlife that surrounded their domains.
* eventually the pariah rediscovered the art of forging and reforging precursor metal.
* The precursors begin to uncover metal structures such as towers, gates and doors beneath the earth which they use to restore their stone structures.
* Precursors deem pariah to be lesser beings, malformations that need not exist on the new world.
* Naya encircles the mesa in the central valley, claiming the crownlands for himself.
* The first hero subjugates several sages, and where he can, transforms worthy pariah into precursors.
* Many precursors notice that by fighting the pariah, they are beginning to degrade physically.
* The precursors absorb lums from the fallen, becoming far greater than they were before.
* Earthern warriors are molded, who encourages the first hero to utilize them as they do not require lums to exist.
* The precursors now more than ever are tutoring their brethren to manipulate lum energies, and soon great spires rise.
* By uncovering ruins and old architecture, they learn lessons about the past, and progress increases significantly.
* The immortal tower is partially uncovered in the heart of the sealed lands, once buried beneath forty meters of solid rock, many precursors relocate.
* The first hero forces the abdication of Nau, reclaiming the east plains, and slays Nau shortly afterwards. The Caste is dissolved in the days that follow.

* the creator still existed and documented his dreams and nightmares within a vegetative state.
* The creator is visited by a warrior, eager to stop the influence of the first hero.
* The creator offers his armor and what remains of his lum energies.

* The second hero challenges Naya at the monastery.

* Maran is attempting to deliver a stone of great power to the second hero, but fails to reach him before his pilgrimage to the peak.
* The second hero is thrown from Naya's Domain, being swept into the river below.

* The war weary survivors, the few remaining which lived outwith Naya's rule, now focused on regaining their strength and forging a new path into an uncertain future.
* the castes were divided on how to approach Naya. Most were content to remain north, while others would not rest until Naya's lands were reclaimed.

## Ideas\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Lore&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Ideas")\]

* you learn later on that all of the ore in a certain area is of much inferior quality to another area, but you were too inexperienced to actually tell the difference, and this was common knowledge to all the blacksmiths in one area, and some of your enemies.
* the winds that had swept the kingdom for years began to die down, and a peaceful quiet returned.
* the unparalled tactician that had fallen at the plains,
* And so shu attacked, sturggling forth fueled only by the dying wishes of their long-departed allies.
* the end of the game is false, the escape of Naya, where the enemies are actually weakened, but not defeated entirely, the game has a full new section of story and a real ending if the player played the game correctly, the main enemies are defeated with certainty.
* nobody reignited the heart; so people were reborn from the scattered lums of the precursors Naya defeated.
* rain, on the rare occasion it does happen on Mar, is often warm to hot, and can be extremely destructive, forming seas overnight.
* if you kill a man when he's fearful. it's a bad omen, so you can absorb his fear to kill him.
* panning over to saul from great distance, showing his work excavating and repairing a precursor ruin showing how precedent the situation is.
* minor plots should evolve into major ones and don't ever start with a big actor unless you plan to start bigger and make it small progressively over time, not instantly as a conclusion either.
* first cutscene should be bad guys making things much worse.
* implant an idea incredibly early, which the player ponders and thinks what could be the meaning behind it, then don't use it until the player has almost erased it entirely from their mind.
* You can choose to stay and fight, which is much harder, and near impossible. The game will not stop you if you decide to stay, it will allow you to stay, but the game will be almost impossible and you'll regret it, and also have no way of reaching new areas.
* an enemy manages to escape at the last second using unknown powers, you think he's still alive. It turns out he died soon after he escaped. You don't discover this until much later, you can then loot him.
* Offered greatest desires by Saul, this however results in a bad ending, offers nothing when bad ending is denied.
* not all choices can be made, choices require sacrifices, choices are sometimes not choices at all, but things you must do due to your own lenience earlier into the game.
* a boss will beg to be spared to help defeat another boss.
* put the player at the same level as the characters, the player should not be correctly assuming their next moves, but interested instead of what the next event could possibly be.
* things mentioned right at the start of the game are extremely important to the later story, done in a way that isn't obvious.
* a secret advantage some people have access to, but won't reveal to others.
* boss was only doing what he was doing for the greater good, and proves without him things would get worse, if he is killed, things will gradually get worse.
* the player will establish things as fact earlier, dialogue and text later on will question the depth and truth of things, and make the player question if there is more depth to these things that they don't currently know about.
* a guild is forced to disband when you're in it, this means losing the rank, and for a time the caste is dispersed and unjoinable, forcing you to go elsewhere.
* during a battle an unknown enemy destroys both sides, you and the Pyrrhic victory enemy are contemplating the loss of the battle.
* throughout the course of the game, you are essentially playing as the grandson of the hero, the hero was killed by the end boss, and the world as a result the world is on the precipice of the end.
* Although Saul was in undeniable control; Sauls power over the world gradually regressed, as he himself became more reclusive, now spending far less time as a conqueror, and instead curating the library.
* you mourn the end boss, after you realise he was right all along.
* Something terrible happens, but the player doesn't have enough context to realize just how bad this is until much later into the story.
* after that battle, many warriors dropped their armaments and armor, ready to now live in the land of peace they had created.
* seemingly meaningless dialogue at the start of the game can make changes to how the game proceeds, choices at the beginning of the game impact starting time of day to be dawn dusk or night.
* waiting for hundreds of years, growing older hidden away at the end of the world, until the threat eventually finds him, and he even then refuses to face it and then he dies.
* more time taken in the game causes the last boss to get harder, however large main story plots reduce this time.
* the end of the game is in plain sight and obvious for most of the game, and is even accessed casually, however actually trying to take on the boss earlier would be foolhardy
* the water caste keep documentation of all the waters on Mar.
* some narrative lore-exploration in the form text concerning animals, plant life or other things with hidden uses and great advantages in gameplay, only available if the player actively searches for and cares about learning more about things.
* Some decisions lead to worse paths, companions may be less well suited to roles and more prone to injury or even death, or cause missions to go unexpected directions. Companions can and will prematurely die if not careful.
* there was a great sea, when it faded, it left salt, we should leave this on the flavor text.
* the player should be able to piece together what the world once looked like, from evidence given by characters. this can help with finding relics or rare materials.
* Saul has hundreds of lums, each time he is defeated he loses only a portion of them, returning hundreds of years later to a world that has grown due to his loss, weaker than before, but still incredibly strong, when he succeeds, he claims these lums back, and then some.
* data mining AI defeated by flooding them with constant useless data.
* lot's of reclaiming, and rebuilding in the universe, things aren't brand new, most things are rebuilt.
* things that the player may notice earlier into the game and say "that's weird" actually become part of the plot later. ideas are left to stew hopefully until the player becomes curious when no other explanation is given, naturally, rather than being told they should be curious.
* the sword when plunged into him, turned him into stone, and the sword and stone sat for hundreds of years, earth covered the stone, until, nobody even knew that the sword had been plunged into the dark being beneath, and, by cruel fate, by withdrawing the sword from the rock, the darkness would once again be set free.

## Rules\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Lore&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Rules")\]

The following is a list of rules all plot must follow:

* The character will not do or says anything that you wouldn't do, and therefore you become so detatched from your character as a result.
* No second chances, the plot moves on regardless if you make mistakes. There are other ways to achieve the same things.
* the full game should play like an origin story.
* just specific enough to give an understanding of what's going on, just generic enough to fill in your own mental images. don't beat someone with unneeded details unless they're important, place key information in the middle and don't draw attention to it until much later.


## 0.1 General\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Summary&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: 0.1 General")\]

0.1-01: a blank world existed that the story would later take place on.

0.1-02: the planes of existence existed beneath the world. These are many incomplete versions of the blank world existing in the form of a stack, where the lowest plane is the most incomplete. Falling from the lowest plane will cause the person to fall from reality itself.

0.1-03: Although items may be extinct on Mar, plants, trees animals and other forms of life can be found within the planes.

0.1-03: A precursor lord named Mar possessed lums and several items he had foraged from these planes. when exiting upon the dead world from the planes of existence. He himself was powered by the volatile nature of lums.

0.1-04: Mar was able to manipulate and traverse each plane through spending multiple lums to do so.

0.1-04: It is generally believed lums and all life originated from somewhere within the planes. Since someone can fall from plane to plane, it was assumed that there may be many lums at the bottom of the planes of existence.

0.1-05: lums were effectively used to save the dead planet igniting the heart of the world. This allowed for the duplication of the lums Mar possessed. Mar created beings in the image of the lord and powered these beings with the volatile nature of lums; naming these precursors.

0.1-05: The precursor lord used his power to start the heart of the world which was composed of lums and was essentially a font of power. The heart of the world is a large area full of lums and shines brightly with the light of lums. It's main purpose is to keep the planet saturated in lums, because without the heart lums begin to fade. The heart of the world can be destroyed.

0.1-05: The first Lum Storms began, essentially dust storms and northern lights caused by the existence of lums, bathed in the twilight glow at night.

0.1:04: Utilizing the inexhaustible heart of the world, an ancient precursor society then existed on Mar, they constructed things like volatile precursor towers and precursor doors on the brand new untouched world.

0.1-04: They would exist in a time where lums were plentiful; using the lums for great constructive efforts, but also great destructive ones. Eventually, not all precursors shared the same ideologies and many lums were permanently used and destroyed. The heart of the world was also destroyed, it's remnant lums scattering.

0.1-04: During the ensuring war, many factions emerged or had existed, such as the Petrifach, Praelians and Praetorians. Many precursors decided to hide in the planes of existence, many other warriors were forcibly banished to the planes. There were those who built great walls to prevent the planes from being accessed and the planes were eventually sealed at the end of the war; trapping many precursors within the planes.

0.1-04: As precursors fell, the few remaining precursors got more powerful by consuming the lums of the fallen. Those precursors proclaimed themselves as sages; beings who held such a wealth of lums they weren't too dissimilar from gods.

0.1-04: Many precursors sacrificed their lums to the heart of the world, attempting to rekindle the heart.

##  A Definition of Lums, The finite source of life.\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Summary&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: A Definition of Lums, The finite source of life.")\]

So essentially, lums power fucking everything, even things as small as plants or as large as animals, trees and people. when you cut a plant little balls of light, kinda like sparks are released from it and can be absorbed by individuals immediately or sometime after the plant has expired. lums can be absorbed from deceased beings. They come in a variety of colours such as copper, pale blue and white.

Their purpose is giving life, beings with more lums tend to be far stronger physically, emotionally and mentally than those with less lums; and although beings can exist without lums they often live a half-life. Most life has formed an addiction to lums; seeking more and more of them.

When lums are destroyed, it equates to a direct and permanent loss of life within the entire universe.

## The people\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Summary&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: The people")\]

The common people in this universe are known as the pariah, and they're called that because their creator wasn't very skilled, and so, they had a lot of problems. They arrived far after lums and far after their creator. their creator obviously had to sacrifice his own lums in order to birth the pariah, and that process was one that damaged him as he had to physically rip the lums from his being.

The pariah were supposed to be dreamless life that stole dreams from others and couldn't make dreams themselves, so I was going to have the creator himself make a massive database of dreams for his pariah to steal.

So, the pariah existed, but they seeked lums because they had so few. ThThe less lums beings have, the more problems they have, the opposite is also true, if people have a ton of lums they're effectively demigods that can cause natural disasters.

the creator of the beings was effectively just a pariah himself that just had thousands upon thousands of lums. I was trying to make a plot where he killed everyone to gather those lums but then i need to write thousands of years of backstory for the universe.
