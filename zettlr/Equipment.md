## Rules\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Equipment&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Rules")\]

* Your equipment and the equipment of your enemy change depending on which faction they decide to follow throughout the game. if you commit yourself down one path, your equipment will change accordingly.
* you can generally visibly tell how good an item is by it's colour. items that are closer to white are superior to those that are more orange and rusted. a slightly orange or brownish weapon is therefore inferior to a light grey weapon. the same applies to the handles, which symbolise mark. legendary weapons will generally not follow this rule, but sometimes can.
* items given to you in combat that can be permanently kept
* Identity is more important than balance. Balance leads to homogenization.
* Allow the players to feel like they're breaking the game and are smarter than the designers.
* every plate of armor has weight and offers defence.

## Ideas\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Equipment&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Ideas")\]

* The armor was preserved even after the destruction of their homeland, and is mentioned in numerous legends, alongside the names of those who are said to have gone beyond death.
* an item that is powerful and can be equipped, but optionally has an ability where it will be permanently destroyed instantaneously for great effect.
