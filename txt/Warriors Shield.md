## Location\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Warriors_Shield&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Location")\]

After the player is granted passage to the [Roost](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Roost&action=edit&redlink=1 "Roost (page does not exist)") by the [Nameless Guard](https://nim.miraheze.org/wiki/Nameless_Guard "Nameless Guard"), the guard advises that the player finds a pair of [Nayan Boots](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Nayan_Boots&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nayan Boots (page does not exist)") to protect themselves from the hot ground, as without one; the ground will be far too hot to traverse.

[The warrior](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=The_warrior&action=edit&redlink=1 "The warrior (page does not exist)") near the tree will offer to give up his shield after speaking to the guard; claiming that the shield is made of Nayan Alloy.

After obtaining the shield. it can either be used as the Warriors Shield or melted down into Nayan Alloy, which can then be used in the creation of [Nayan Boots](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Nayan_Boots&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nayan Boots (page does not exist)")

When in possession of the Nayan Alloy, the merchant can advise the player in the process to create Nayan boots; but refuses to lower the price of the boots in his possession.

If the player is unable to retrieve a Shield in either chapter 1, chapter 2 or chapter 3, the warriors shield is dropped by the warrior once he is slain.

## Usage\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Warriors_Shield&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Usage")\]

Since the Shield is indestructible, it is, in most cases, generally superior to the Wooden Shield, the player will not obtain another Nayan Shield until far later in the game. Given the rarity of Nayan Alloy, it will most likely not be in the players possession very long.
