Today I've been working on Selection mechanics for Interactible Entities.
I realized that I wanted a 3D mouse, similar to Black and White 2's mouse that was able to pick up things in the world, but also to interact with a 2D layer like
an inventory to place those items in.

 I came to the realization that this is what FPS games do when they want a gun to render above other meshes
