* Taking some inspiration from final fantasy 1 (i.e. time loop)

There is no sequel to this game. Instead, the last act of the gae gives extreme foreshadowing for what will come to pass following the end of the game. The last act essentially IS the post-game. there is no need for a summary..

* Show an object early into the game which has little known significance, and so it is ignored - but explain it's significance later.
* you go down a waterfall and there is loot scattered in the waterfall at various levels
* an object that is allegedly of great significance, a character mentions being prepared for when it appears again
it never does.

just because you don't see all the puzzle pieces doesn't mean they're not there
a character that has way more going on behind the scenes than what is ever shown to the player
have easter eggs before and after

Prae died.
there was a time where Prae was truly gone.
but is now being ressurected.

the sages come to offer gifts, lums to help with this process.
others do not want this process to commence, or complete.
as they do not wish to see Prae roam Mar again.

he chased them all down. and he petrified them all. but as significant loss to himself.
in the end he was almost wraith-like, and struggled to keep a coporeal form. 


The organisation is wiped out to the point where it exists only in small enclaves. 

Precursors are born sexless due to the anti-androgen qualities of from both eco and lums
essentially making them sexless beings.
however, foods found on Mar contain large sources of pythoestrogens, meaning that most precursors have a feminine appearence.   



levels should, maximum, be 70 minutes of maximum length
this is the maximum expected to be completed in a single sitting.
the player can opt into-
and within the 2 hours, individual reward-tasks should take 3-5 minutes to complete.

it is time for our kind to leave this land, my friend

leave it to these mortals?
you must be mad. 
you may leave, but I and others must remain to defend the heart
and protect these mortals. 
you may trust them with such power
I however cannot

this whole world was precursor business whilst you were gone.
what's changed?

we came back. 



the real final boss is hidden and behind the scenes. 
naya is just the visible one.


One day we will be on the same side again.


the door to the final boss remains locked if you used unethical ways of beating the game.


I died over there anyways, 


I wish circumstance hadn't chosen you.


Ingredients all have a unique effect, and are only found in a single region of the world, for example
ashroot is only found in Indorin and must be combined with Glassleaf from Oradin to make a Healing Potion

later into the game, the game provides better ways of being able to collect higher quantities of these without
manually picking. 

the game generally will present a seemingly time-intensive task, but then later greatly mitigate that by reducing the
time taken. 

they found a way to collect the ingredient, but were unable to use it, and talk about their efforts to use it.

Quests will introduce a mob that quickly drains health, but will also tell you how to mitigate the issue using
an ingredient, however, doesn't provide the ingredient. 


there is high level loot in some areas, but it can be hard to find unless you already know where it is.

levitation is used to access hidden areas with loot, but is also a key part of some higher level areas which require
levitation to be accessed at all. 


you will randomly find a full intact set of very powerful precursor armor just laying on the ground 
after an extensive period of hardly being able to find anything at all.

a lot of things are hidden in plain sight, like keys, and locked doors that require puzzles. 

one area  very unexpectantly has access to the underground precursor pipeline

an enchanted item found underwater with an enchantment that makes it unusably heavy. and difficult to get out of
the water it is found in. regular disenchantment spells will not work. 
the enchantment can be removed when hit with an arrow of disenchantment, making it one of the best helmets in the game.  

The enemy will enchant your weapon making it effectively useless
to defeat the end boss you need a guantlet, a hammer, and a lockpick all on important characters
one of these items acquired will be fake.

the speaking demigod statues around the world are not statues, and are actually precursors affected with petrifaction.
Why didn't Prae destroy the beings, rather than having them frozen in adamantine?
killing precursors would free their lum energies out into the world.
but as the heart was destroyed, the petrifach blades were made to trap lums rather than destroy precursors. 
Petrifach blades could not destroy precursors, but they could cause their flesh to turn to adamantine, trapping
lums inside. 
Only Prae himself was able to absorb lums from these trapped beings, but, Prae, in eventually expending the massive amount of energy to reform the heart, 
he was unable to collect these lums

The adamantine statues were often left where they stood, having structures built around them either to be studied,
protected, imprisoned, or hidden. 

The precursor known as Nerevar didn't die when tossed from the Monastery. his lums were instead trapped within the
stone decorating his blade, and the stone was then prized from the blade. 
unknowingly contained the soul of the first hero. 
many years later, the stone would be used in the creation of new Precursors.
many precursors believed themselves to be reincarnations of Nerevar 

 one of which being the player.  

a main quest item that when equipped will sap all of your lums obtained up until that point. without the Preserveral 
you will die when this happens.

a ring that will instantly kill you if equiped as you are not the chosen hero




some of the later precursors managed to use a technique by drinking unicorn blood prior to battle - they wouldn't be permanently frozen/ - this instead dyed their skin a deep blue and caused them to
have adamantine blood. their skin became resilient, and their blood, adamantial, became prized as a result.

infact, many precursors built additional false statues to conceal their true one.
these statues are often made from a false adamantine: precursor metal dyed green with adamantial, 
or the blood of freed precursors.  

A chest puzzle where each chest contains a key, at the end of the chain of chests is a reward.

The last quest in the game after the final boss involves accessing a door that throughout the entire game was 
thought to be inaccessible and it changes everything 

There are even a few false adamantine doors. 

a secret type of weapon only wielded by ancient statues, it can even be dropped, but crumbles to dust if the player
attempts to pick it up. 

an arrow must be fired into a hdiden target at the back of a statue.

Some frozen precursors grew guilty, sacrificied their ability to speak and became sanctuaries, their statue instead radiating the lum energies contained within

one precursor has managed to transfer themselves into an adamantine orb instead of a statue.
the orb was once part of another statue.  

a cave where you must levitate to reach the entrace of a dungeon 

It is a seemingly very insignificant place, but inside, if the player levitates, they can find
an underwater, hidden precursor ruin containing the adamantine mail, 
adamantine mail, one of the strongest and lightest materials known to exist forged into the form of a lightweight
piece of equipment. impossible to recreate. 
 
one of the most valuable items in the game.

I am the lucid dream

the title proa chooses to take when he awakens.

after an enemy is defeated, he is not destroyed. 
but weakened entirely and allowed to live.

the good character breaks so much that he effectively wants to die to prevent himself from falling deeper into his corruption

the enemy that you think was going to take over incredibly quickly, is instead, frozen in stone unable to act at all
their ambitions at an end

your greatest advesary is frozen in rock, and speaks to you as a friend rather than an advesary at the end of the world. 






a character dies at the beginning of the game allowing you to pick up and use their extremely powerful weapon
you can even hide it for later, if you know how
if not, the weapon will be removed from you at a certain point.
the questline focuses upon one object sole world object being constructed/repaired and then activated
* you traverse up a waterfall using a hookshot at various levels. 
* the questline focuses upon one object sole world object being constructed/repaired and then activated.
* you can only grab the weapon once, as it is falling, in midair. if you don't grab it you can never obtain it.
* An incredibly powerful antagonist that you don't even know exists is defeated by the antagonist
as both antagonists were once allies.
* eventually most of the factions need to band together as most of the issues at the beginning of the plot pale in significance
to the later developments.

When in any of these scenarios, the player can die and be teleported back to the 5 character selection screen.

* an overpowered item that will make things easier, but it can only be used once.
* an npc that must be paid a lot of money for you to access an area, although it is accessible without his help, you'd surely die.

* It was not a desirable region, yet, he lost much to acquire it.
* he exploited the land. the workers complained, but he made them adapt. relics were uncovered. warnings existed here. but he did not seek to learn from the past. One day, the lum was uncovered.

* After you usurp the "end-boss" you continue the game as the now "new-boss"
* a single torch that is lit at the beginning of the game, it's light must be carried from that point to all other points.
* put puzzles in the second game that's solutions are found within the first game.
* borrowed wealth may indeed be borrowed...yet, it is still wealth.
* He defeats the enemy with assured decision making and retreats by the safest route.
* as the misguided rule continued, he sequestered himself within the city walls and refused to come out.
* In addition, with gone there were none who could match his intellect. Realising this fact he later disappeared. he refused to participate and dispatched his son, in his stead.
* This was the beginning of a coup d'etat,
* He is too ill even to meet with me? Yes. Recently he's begun to forget things, I don't think he'll ever recover. Please Give my regards to the general. by the way, where is the general right now.
* Even with supreme power, there are some things that cannot be controlled.
* this would be the last struggle the final throes of a dying kingdom.
* As they looked upon the army, the sagacious generals thought to themselves why would naya not participate in this battle? why did he send us instead.
* He had hiding his poor health for years, despite participating in countless battles.
* enemies, allies, even his own family.
* It was a fitting end to one of the most cunning intellectuals the land had known.
* meanwhile, determined to rebuild its strength, remained quiet as it recovered.
* It is in it's purest state, but it's purest state is not equal to it's strongest state, it had to be combined, some may view that as tainting it from what it once was, but through this, it became stronger.
* he was going to kill the person that wronged him the most, only to be a dawn away from doing so, but when he arrived, his enemy had already been entirely destroyed by other unknown force. He felt grateful to this unknown force, but became wary of their own power in the region, and the harm they could now pose.
* the blacksmith will stop helping you when you cross his personal lines, and you will need to look for another to help you with your task.
* when crafting, you can craft unfinished items, an unfinished chainbody will provide some protection, but not nearly as much as a fully completed item. items can be completed later.
* one exceptionally rare item that can either be used or given back.
* a key obtained from one location required to access an entirely different location.
* a hidden quest of great importance and changes things dramatically.
* I'm counting on you.
* the economy reacts. you can't just sell 100 steel bars to a store and expect that price to stay constant. Selling items to stores is generally more of a quest-like retrieval system: an npc approaches the store and requests a good. if that good isn't available, a quest is created to obtain what the store requires. that item could then be passed to the faction that requires it.
* the longer you stay alive, the weaker your allies become, the longer the main antagonist stays alive, the weaker the land becomes.
* i'd rather not be injured before the war begins.
* an item that is replaced with another item with similar or lesser ability after the faction is wiped out.
* the first boss is killable but only by the very few, when the boss wins he chops off your arm.
* The player first encounters the Hives during the quest What Tomorrow Brings.
* an area where rebuilding a shrine will allow you to make sacred oil which you can use to cure the surrounding corruption of the area, but it will eventually be corrupted again. you can try to keep it cured and even unlock a quest after curing to permanently cure it.
* the ability to reload your save and try again is actually a game mechanic obtained by extremely difficult means that most players won't be able to obtain. if obtained it will be acknowledged by npcs across the world, some npcs will even refuse to fight you honourably since they know within the infinite possibilities of reloading, they will always lose.
* when presenting the narrative to the reader include no hard dates at all, maybe just a single hard date so that they can piece the rest of the timeline in place, make sure the timeline is coherent and makes sense on this side though.
* a boss that permanently makes one of your abilities weaker, changing it forever.
* an item that allows you to unlock a new talent tree.
* talent trees are faction specific and unlocked by following factions.
* factions have unique buildings or armour sets with unique abilities and specific uses.
* talents that don't seem like they'd work together or stack from multiple factions actually do stack. using talents in intelligent ways can allows for some interesting combinations.
* a character that died and has no mortal form, but can become something new to help the surrounding land.
* a general ability that is so situational and pointless that it only really makes sense to use it for one area, and in that one area it is extremely powerful.
* transfer a negative effect from someone else to yourself
* spells can be stolen or dispelled.
* each race at the start of the game is it's own faction, one race might be hostile to another races cities, or might not be.
* when you kill a rare npc, the lum or item that makes them rare is dropped by them and is named by them, when it is looted from them, they will be a normal npc even if resurrected. then that item or lum can be named by you, consuming the lum or equipping that item will make you rare.
* I failed once before, but I will not do so again. If you do not do this, I will find another who will.
* a mob from far later in the game might appear as a rare mob in a lower level area of the game, and be level scaled appropriately but drop the same resources as if it was the real thing.
* only have one dlc. it's a pain in the ass to install and extremely expensive, in the advertising and in reality, it doesn't do anything at all but spawn a white light behind a rock wall that you need to stand at a very specific angle to ever see.
* the walls were not for protection, the warrior had a duty. the walls were meant to imprison them.
* A warrior, he's still in there somewhere, but his legacy can only live on with his death.
* an item of once huge importance now has no use at all and is practically a junk item, but can be picked up anyway.
