been busy at work this week but was thinking about enemy design.

The thing that defines if an enemy is hostile is if the bone connection from
it's torso to it's head remains intact.

a robot might still have arms and legs, but unless it has a head, it won't be
hostile.

all the code needs to do is check if the connection is intact, and if not,
change the behavioural profile of the entity.

the connection could weaken (i.e. break loose) at around 50% hp, but it'd
still remain hostile.

I guess this also means joint connections and also individual body parts have
 individual health components. (that affect the main health component?)
 Head, neck, torso, shoulder_joint_L, shoulder_joint_R, arm_L, arm_R etc.
