Smithing is the Creation of Equipment or Objects, such as weaponry and Armor from Metals, Ingredients and Parts.

The Player will first discover this skill When reaching, entering and reactivating the Desolated Workshop. Although once a fully funcitonal workshop, it has since fallen into disrepair, meaning that it must first be repaired to be operational.

The knowledge to repair the smith comes from elsewhere in the game, as well as techniques that can be used to create new Equipment.

Folded Blades - Blades created with multiple metals, to create marbled alloys, greatly increasing the durability of a weapon. Reforging - taking a damaged blade and modifiying it, or seperating a blade into it's constituent parts. Cored Blades - Blades with a 'Core' such as a Precursor or Adamantine Rod, or Other cores.

One of the weapons obtained early into the game has a Precursor Core, yet, the player will not know this without the knowledge of Cored Blades, and may trade this blade away.

## The Smith\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Smithing&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: The Smith")\]

a smith comes out of retirement for the player, many of the people he has forged weaponry or armor for rarely return, he is often given old armors or weapons he himself created to repair or to repurpose. He will offer you some of his more regretful pieces of expensive and powerful equipment for free. 3 He worked with metals of all types, when he matured he studied and researched the properties of precursor metal and had invested interest in uncovering how such materials were synthesized.

He once provided heroes with impeccable equipment made from a metal unlike any which occurred naturally. His own metal was but a poor attempt at recreating the perfection of the precursor blades, with inferior metals. Alas, more often than not, that same equipment would find it's way back to him condemned, in need of repair or untouched by the relatives of deceased heroes.

After several decades of receiving equipment, remembering who had bought it, who had died wielding it, it waned heavily on his mind.

Although superior to many blades, they were still far inferior to the precursor metal. smiths fail to reproduce or even repair his equipment.

he believes that the precursor ruins should remain buried.

He will give you a broken weapon that keeps losing power until it breaks, then it can never be repaired, but it's very powerful weapon. he is extremely emotional and considers this weapon to be his finest weapon, he really doesn't want to give it away, but he really does believe that you will succeed with it.

* "It may look like rust...but this is a folded blade..A fine sheet of Precursor Metal folded many times into the blade"
* "This is a cored blade, and..an exceptionally rare one at that. They used all kinds of things as a core, Given the weight, perhaps Precursor metal...maybe even adamantine?"
