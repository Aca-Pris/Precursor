The tree was nearing extinction as it produced very little fruit or seeds over the course of a season. Most attributed it's recovery to the [emergent sea](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Emergent_sea&action=edit&redlink=1 "Emergent sea (page does not exist)").

It is occasionally found in subterranean locations or on rocky vertical cliff-faces which lack light. It was capable of both subterranean and high altitude growth, however in decades past it was rarely found in nature unless it's ideal conditions were met.

The tree produced a tasteless spotted pale-grey fruit at the end of it's lifespan using deposits of minerals it kept at it's root.

Hours after the fruit was dropped from the tree, the fruit would quickly lose it's firmness, and that seed would use the fruit to germinate.

The tree drops it's fruit into deeper valleys. this process has made the lowest forests on Mar the most nutrient rich. This was an issue well documented by precursors of the high peaks, often needing to collect the fruit from the water.

Commonly, if the fruit is consumed, it is firstly boiled in saltwater and then dried, which sweetens the fruit. This is seen as the traditional way of consumption. It isn't often consumed raw.
