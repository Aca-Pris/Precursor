TheÂ Shield is made of tough, hard wood and offers good protection. Because of its composition, however, it burns easily if it comes into contact with fire.

If the player loses their shield, they can purchase a new one. These are often placed in areas where there is a risk of the shield being destroyed.

The symbol carved on the shield is a symbol of the Amari.
