The **Precursor Gauntlet** is first obtained at the midpoint of the first dungeon after the [Weakened Precursor](https://nim.miraheze.org/wiki/Weakened_Precursor "Weakened Precursor") encounter, with this weaker variant of a fully-functional guantlet, it becomes possible to interact with rusted levers, or push precursor objects

an additional precursor guantlet can be found in a later dungeon, which will the now allow for the player to pick up (rather than slide) certain objects, and can now slide even heavier objects. 

the precursor gauntlet can finally then be upgraded to lift heavy objects remotely and from a distance later into the game. 

The Precursor Gauntlets primary purpose is to channel Eco. and Initially, the player will only be able to channel Blue Eco through the gauntlet, however, the Gauntlet can be improved to channel Lum energies, several abilities become accessible by utilizing the gauntlet: 

The Precursor Gauntlet requires Eco to function, and therefore, the player must have absorbed Eco to utilize the guantlet, either from a Precursor Vent, or from a Precursor Flask. 

Econesis - Can move any object using eco, this will drain eco based on the objects movement. enemies may also be thrown or lifted (cc'd) in this way. Gauntlet will gradually overheat.  

Ecoblast - Charges up and then releases 1 large sphere of condensed eco at a targeted enemy, dealing damage. For every 0.1 seconds the blast is charged, the blast will consume an additional 1 eco and cause an additional 1 damage. The blast is fired if no eco remains, or if the player is damaged. Gauntlet will be Overheated after each blast.  

Ecoblast (Unstable) - Immediately releases 3 small spheres of uncondensed eco, dealing damage to random nearby targets. Each sphere costs 6 eco and deals 3 damage. Causes overheating stacks and guantlet damage.   

When the gauntlet overheats, the gauntlet becomes unusable for a small amount of time until it is cooled down. the gauntlet can be cooled down by objects in the environment, such as a pool of water, but will automatically cool down after a short amount of time.  

  

  
The player will often discover things in the world that can only be lifted/interacted with using the third variant of the guantlet, but some locations become accessible with the second variant. 

Previously inaccessible areas will open up thanks to the guantlet, including within previously completed dungeons.
