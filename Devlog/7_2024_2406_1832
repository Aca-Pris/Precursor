Long time no work!

been busy at work these last few weeks, but I've still been thinking about the project.

I think I may include the Zettlr files. so those will be uploaded alongside This, this just allows me to also work on the Zettlr stuff on the go
and that stuff is mostly just text files anyways.

So the idea is, if I edit something over in Zettlr,
it should also update here, and if I push it, I should then be able to edit it from anywhere
