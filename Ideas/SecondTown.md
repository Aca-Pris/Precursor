SecondTown is the Second town travelled too by the player following the completion of the Precursor Tower. A notable feature of this town is that it is always raining, and the town heavily features blue shades.

Depending on the players choices. SecondTown will either be powered or unpowered when it is first visited. Even when in an unpowered state, much of the town is functional.

## Smith\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=SecondTown&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Smith")\]

The player will meet the Smith in Secondtown. However the Smith itself isn't functional and requires many components to become functional again. If the town is unpowered the puzzles will be unpowered. and although may still be completed, might be completed in more damaging ways. For example, a door must now be blown up. Which would've been important later in the saving of the Blacksmith.

To Obtain the Foldslicer, the player must first go to the mine, and discover the Unknown Device, bringing it back to the Smith alongside Citric Acid obtained from the Alchemist will allow the Foldslicer to be repaired. With the Foldslicer the player will be able to snip the Foldmetal nodes from earlier. The Smith will explain that it is impossible to smelt Foldmetal but that it can however be twisted and folded.

After learning Prospecting and learning how to create Foldmetal The player is then able to craft a Foldmetal Blank, and the first weapon in the game, the Foldblade if they collect enough Foldmetal.

### Foldblade for the Mercenary:\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=SecondTown&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Foldblade for the Mercenary:")\]

A mercenary will ask to borrow your weapon, if you give him the Foldblade he will help you clear the mine. The mine is full of difficult to defeat creatures and the mercenary is more powerful than you are. at the end of the mine, he will tell you that he intends to keep the blade as payment. If you attempt to fight him he will most likely win the fight and rob you. In the unlikely event you beat the mercenary, you will find a precursor device on his body.

  

if you bring the blacksmiths own weapons back to him; he'll tell you about the adventurers he sold them too, and what they hoped to achieve, although they clearly failed in their tasks, you could attempt to solve their loose ends.

The blacksmith will offer you a quest early into the game, but can't complete it until much, much later when the circumstances have entirely changed.

A quest where if you lose you give up your sword.
