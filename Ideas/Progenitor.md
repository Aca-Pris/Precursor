Progenitor is the name given to the strongest form of Precursor, in that they can create other Precursors or Pariah, this is due to having a significant over-abundance of nim energies which they can give to others.

With enough energies, Progenitors can create objects such as pearls or even the Heart of the World, but in this process they often become Precursors or Pariah.
