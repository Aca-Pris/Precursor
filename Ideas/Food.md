## Ideas\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Food&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Ideas")\]

The following is a list of ideas not yet structured into foods.

* very few precursors were ever granted the right to cultivate herbs, much less to pick quality herbs found on the crownlands. Instead, due to Mar's failing ecology and non-existent cultivation, most foods were foraged foods such as berries, nuts, algae, roots and fruits, many of which were rare in their own right.
* Most travellers tended to carry fat extracted from leaves. They often collected herbs as they travelled, exchanging these with others, some were quite rare and valuable. They prepared meals at small camps. Travellers seldom carried meat, often cooking and consuming immediately at the source.
* A rare fruit was the Sapote, with a black interior and strong outer tan shell, wet chocolate like texture, very similar one grows which is more like dirt.
* A lesser-known yet great way to find meat was coastlines, where there were often a large assortment of breem hidden in plain sight, however, only a select group of travellers actually know of these methods of obtaining meat.. which was often eaten fried in fat; some deep diving fish have a unique flavor profile.
* Some birds also laid small eggs, and these were also quite valuable as a food source, but were incredibly rare, and in limited supply. A favorite of many travelers was a herb baked egg.
* Due to the long food related struggle and old habits regarding consumption, most newly produced foods still conformed to old foraging techniques and flavor combinations, prior to the widespread adoption of foraging, most were using the bitter herbs Styrian, Estery, Gentian found in the Valley of Subnt, often disgarded in later years, in order to develop unique flavor profiles. There are now extinct spices that were completely wiped out before they could evolve defences because of how sought after they were. some still exist in a preserved state.
* steamed buns, describes to player how he added ingredients to improve the flavor since the players last visit.
* creative culinary
* there are now extinct spices that were completely wiped out before they could evolve defences because of how tasty they were. rumor has it some still exist in a preserved state.
