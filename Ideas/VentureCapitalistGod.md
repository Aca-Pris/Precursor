Venture Capitalist God

It's a wierd game where you can uncover dinousaur bones and then your researchers can
find out how to use them to build a rollercoaster.

it's also a little like a ren faire, so you can have a stall that sells turkey legs; but you need to have a turkey 
farm.

like a normal rts you'll need like people to mine for metal and cut down trees. 


you can get sponsorships from like a chocolate clan, and they will want to modify your log flume to a chocolate theme
or a soap clan wants to do the same and they fight over your sponsorship

there are rival theme parks

rides attract visitors and you unlock new rides overtime.

there is also hotel management, and even some golf course management.

or, you can open valhalla as like a public attraction and ride

it combines fantasy, relic uncovering, with a theme park management and god game.

going for wierdness on the level of brutal legend
