Welcome to Precursor!

this is the first Devlog for Precursor
It has been in-dev for a while (since 2017)
and I'm just getting around to making something like this.

The game is being made in Godot. but by using .tres files
I should be able to make or edit items remotely from
Pulsar.

This is great If I want to do some game-dev in bed, or
on the go, which is the main intentions of having something
like this setup.

These devlogs are mostly just comments I have on the
current development, what I am currently working on,
or figuring out.

As of right now, the bulk of Text for Precursor is
actually being held locally in Zettlr
(a free Obsidian alternative).
and various small txt files on my main PC.

I might move them to this repo at some point.

Expect to see .tres files though.
