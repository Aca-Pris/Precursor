"Recently, the number of these fish has decreased tremendously, so I'm going to release this one.

**Loaches**, are notorious both for their rarity and for the difficulty catching one presents. The Loach closely resembles an actual species of fish called the Bowfin.

The process of catching a loach is complicated, and can be broken down into a few key steps. Firstly, the player must obtain Precursor Boots during the first chapter over other items, which will allow them to walk over the hot land to reach the Orb.

In the second chapter, Naya will control the location where the Orb once was even if the player obtains the Precursor Boots; transporting the Orb deep into Nayan territory. Although the Orb is still technically obtainable; not without having to enter Naya's citadel.

In the third chapter, the Precursor Boots will become unobtainable, but their stronger variant, the Precursor Boots will be available.

The flower has a few key purposes in the game, and the player must carefully choose which purpose to use it for, one of the purposes is for the flower to become bait to catch the Loach.
