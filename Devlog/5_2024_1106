I think the game should start on a sky-island

the reason for the sky-island is because it's better than having a sea of
blue energy that wouldn't make much sense for the plot.

there are some optional things to do before the cavern that result in orbs.

in this cavern, they should also discover the mining laser, but it's useless
right now.

The player discovers the adamantine statue at the end of the cavern, who is
willing to trade a capsule in exchange for orbs.

the statue tells the player that deeper into the mine is a pool of blue energy
and they can fill the capsule at this well,
and that they can use the capsule with the mining laser
