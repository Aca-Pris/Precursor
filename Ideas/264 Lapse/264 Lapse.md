The 264 year lapse that occured between the petrifaction and the awakening was a time where several new factions emerged. Prae had entered a near-death state, and the heart had been immeasurably weakened. The initial peoples that evaded the petrifaction referred to the world as Marred, eventually becoming just Mar.

They had settled on the grassy temperate western lands. It was not long before they noticed the land begin to change, due to the great weakening of the heart, the great plains of Mar began a process of rapid desertification

lums visibly disipated across the plains into the atmosphere

this great drought meant that available lum energies had to be fully utilized. the breakthrough of the lum battery allowed cooling systems to be developed that would prevent total desertification. and eventually the first droids, which were used for mining. The focus became the discovery of lost lums in caverns, and building infrastructure projects. although the heart was an excellent source of lums, due to the petrifach, it would be foolish attempting to do so.

100 years passed

as the climate continued to worsen, many infrastructure projects had been completed, others abandoned entirely, as the pariah and the droids together endured the worst of the sandstorms, much had been lost. many had relocated underground, continuing to discover additional technologies.

200 years passed

as the weakened heart recovered, the climate began to stabilize. explorers would seek to unlock the doors left behind by the early pariah, batteries were sold as rare trinkets, and used to reactivate long-forgotten droids. some had discovered the link between the batteries and the droid infrastructure projects, like Naya, and hoped to rediscover technology from the now buried ruins.

264 years

the sages begin to reawaken.
