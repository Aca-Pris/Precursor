Dreams were stolen by the dreamless creations of Prae who forged Precursor Relics to utilize the dreams.

After defeating the first boss, the Wounded Precursor, the player will gain access to the Gauntlet. which will always contain the Dream of Channeling.

dreams can be bound to Relics.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |Relics
| Guantlet | Obtained following the Wounded Precursor fight. contains the Dream of Channeling by default. must be repaired using Engineering skill. |
| Shield | Obtained from the Warrior by the tree. is the only Precursor item which can be used without Dreams or Eco. Can be melted down. |
| Bow | The Bow must be traded for the gauntlet. |
| Blade | Obtained by resmelting the shards together within the abandoned forge. requires overcharging the gauntlet to destroy the door. requires the broken sword. Requires melting down the shield. |
| Staff | Crafted from a Stick and the Blade |

Eco is the energy that must be channelled through relics to utilize dreams.

Blue eco, once an incredibly powerful eco, has been lost from the world, and with it, light and Rich ecos are now impossible to create. The first source of Eco in the game is the Trader, who will sell the player a Bottle of Cyan Eco, which can be used to unlock the door to the Precursor Ruin.

In the world, the player will be able to naturally find sources of Red, Green and Cyan ecos.

When the player reaches the Refinery, they are optionally able to perform a one-time exchange of one permanent eco color (Green, Cyan or Red) in return, they will recieve a permanent source of a mixed color. (Amber, Cyan, Purple, Brown, Orange)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |Primary Eco
| Cyan Eco | Energy |
| Red Eco | Strength |
| Green Eco | Life |

There are Additive Eco's, which are harder to create. Ecos mix similarly to light and are additive.

| --- | --- |
| Green Eco | Life |
| Rich Eco | (Inaccessible) |
| Blue Eco | (Inaccessible) |
| Light Eco | (Inaccessible) |
| Amber Eco (Red + Green) | Strength |
| Cyan Eco (Blue + Green) | Energy and Life |
| Red Eco | Heat |

It is possible to obtain Blue eco from Cyan eco, and therefore obtain Rich and Light ecos by using the Dream of Seperation, however, the quantity of eco obtained in this way is ineffective.

In lesser Shaping, any object that has a high enough purity to one specific element can be chemically changed by adding or subtracting protons from it, forming a new atom using only the hands of the individual, but cannot be broken down.

In greater Shaping, entire objects can be broken into protons neutrons and electrons and reconstructed to form any new elements desired, given that the remaining ingredients do not require fusion to form.

The simplest form of conversion is to drop from one element to the next lower element on the periodic table: for example from He to H, or N to C by simply getting rid of one proton from the source element. The "dumped" proton would essentially be a Hydrogen.

First it temporarily nullified the idea of matter. Every element within the focus of the spell would suddenly (and without cataclysmic energy transfer) decompose into its component subatomic particles and a free-floating form of the binding energies which used to hold them together. This would create a floating ball of non-elemental soup made of unattached protons, neutrons, electrons and energy; all swirling around each other, momentarily free from the organized patterns which we call elements.

Then from that soup, the magic would extracted enough of each type of subatomic particles to build the desired quantity of the element which the caster desired.

While maintaining the first aspect of the spell for all of the left over particles, the caster would now release the selected particles back into the normal universe. There, in obedience to the laws of physics, they would instantly arrange themselves into atoms of the desired element. If that arrangement required or released any energy, the magic would harmlessly draws it from or pours it into the non-elemental soup.

This is where the spell gets tricky. The desired element has been created, but the caster is now holding a ball of potential matter and it is taking all of his concentration to keep it from re-entering real space to catastrophic, potentially nuclear effect.

To safely defuse the situation, after each successful casting of the spell, the caster must extract additional elements until all of the left over pieces and stray energies are gone. Think of it as the worst molecular chemistry test that you have ever had to take, and your life is forfeit if you fail. If the caster looses control of the spell before the non-elemental zone is empty, boom!

If he fails and is very lucky, the contents and energies will happen to match a whole number of hydrogen atoms. This unlikely outcome leaves the caster surrounded by one of the most volatile gases in nature (Think Hindenburg). Alternatlively, the numbers won't quite work out for hydrogen, so fusion will be needed to resolve the left overs into something real. (Think Hiroshima, only bigger).
