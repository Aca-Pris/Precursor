The Blade is older than Mar itself, and it was fashioned aeons ago. Forged from materials that even the finest minds cannot fathom, its blade is sharp enough to cut through rock. and its sculpted surface flickers with unknown energies which paint glittering arcs of destruction as it is swung.

“The metals within this blade and its crafting style are like nothing else on Mar. The beauty and keenness of the weapon have led many to speculate wildly on its true origin”

Unbeknownst to it's wielder, the ancient sword has a secret. Its blade is made from chronophagic alloy. This means that whenever its wielder cuts a life short with the blade, the natural lifespan that is stolen from the victim will be added to the wielder's own, in the form of lums.

The blade is thought to be the origin of the first lum.
