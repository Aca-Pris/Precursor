you'll pay for this....you and all your kind.  

it seems yoru the one pays now my friend 

you think me some petty death dealer. a strange target. why me when so many others do the same. 

you believe yourself different? oh, but I am. for I serve a far nobler cause, just as my brothers. 

ah, i am but a piece, a man with a part to play. you'll come to know the others soon enough.  

good. I look forward to ending their lives as well.  

\[2\] 

 The endless dream calls to me.  

but before i close my eyes, what will become of the pariah 

you mean those suffering your experiments? they'll be free now to return to their homes. 

homes? what homes. the caves?  

you took these people against their will.  

yes. what little will there was for them to have. 

I want to play with fire, what would you say? "as you wish!"? 

ahh but then you'd answer for his burns 

these are not children, they are fully grown. 

you truly believe you were helping them? 

it's not what I believe...it's what I know.    

\[3\]  

 my part is played.  

I took them not to sell, but to save 

and you'd doom us all. for no other reason, than it was asked of you.  

you profit from it. from lives lost and broken. 

you would think that. ignorant as you are. 

do you see the irony in all this. No. not yet it seems. but you will.    

\[4\]  

 in time...you'll come to know them. I think perhaps you already do 

then why hide. 

is it so different from your own work?  

you take the lives of men and women. strong in the conviction that their death will improve the lvies of those left behind. a final evil for a greater good. we are the same. 

No. we are nothing alike. ah but I see it in your eyes. you doubt. You cannot stop us. we will have our new world.    

 \[5 killing this guy opens up the monastery and stops monastery abductions\] 

how can you claim to speak for the people. 

you disciplined them without reason, stole their food, forced them into service under you. 

everything I did I did to prepare them for the new world. 

stole their food? no. I took possession so that when the lean times came, it could be rationed properly.  

look around. my district is without crime. save those commited by you. and as for the conscription. they were not being trained to fight. they were being taught order and discipline. these things are hardly evil.  

\[6\] 

 i followed my orders. believing in my cause. same as you.         

 \[7\]    

 your death opens a door. nothing personal.    

 well, maybe just a little personal.
