I was thinking about how a ground pound component might work these last few days

I'd like the player to be able to ground pound only after a successful
double jump has fired.

so if the player has the double jump component, then ground-pounding becomes
available as a component.

how it would work is, the player is given a fast downwards momentum, and a
ray is attached to the player facing downwards.

while ground-pounding, if there is a ray intersection then it interacts
with the interactible.
