The story is told through a series of acts:

Prior to Act 1.

* Mar had been abandoned as Precursors left to create their own domains.
* However, realized their limitations as they strayed further from Mar.
* Mar, and it's heart of the world, were the only thing capable of producing new lums
* However the heart had been drained for quite some time, and Mar became inhospitable. 
* The heart had enabled high Precursor society including the Lum pipeline and the city of Hiraeth.
* However lums were not being produced quickly enough and the land entered a drought.
* Prae had suggested that the precursors leave to these domains.
* As Prae himself had stayed in attempts to create a new race that did not require lums.
* Prae tried and failed many times to create a new race, the first attempts were short-lived and made mistakes
* most of the beings faded quickly, were not good, or gave up on themselves.
* Prae was eventually successful in creating the Pariah
* Pariah could only exist using a powersource called Lums which were granted to them by Prae
* For an unknown reason, the heart had stopped and a great lum drought began.
* discovering his true power originated from the heart, many rose against Praetor viewing him as a false god.
* the heart was also destroyed, and many Precursors took singular parts of it. 
* Many Precursors chose to escape into Personal Domains, naming themselves inheritors. 
* Others stayed to fight against a now weakened Praetor; Many being turned to adamantine statues.
* Praetor was eventually able to regain control and restored a weakened fragile heart.
* and was able to create beings known as the petrifach, who carried petrifach blades, turning their combatants to adamantine. 
* but eventually, he succeeds in creating the Pariah, a flawed, but coporeal race. 
* He then grants each an object, a Pearl, naming them Sages.
* A pearl allowed the Sage to tap into the power of the Heart of the World. 
* Sages were the Lords of Prae, sent out unto Mar to build Domains of their own. 
* Some time passes and many of the Sages were successful in building their Domains, others were not.
* The sages are able to communicate and collaborate, as a result, Mar enters a time of discovery
* The first relics discovered are made of an unknown metal, later named Precursor metal. 
* It is shared amongst the numerous Sages and their castes including Prae.
* Naya finds Ruins of an ancient tower, naming it the Precursor Tower.
* Naya establishes his first lab overlooking the PrecursorTower, eventually relocating inside.
* From writings found within the PrecursorTower, Naya discovers a larger ruin, Hiraeth, and begins to uncover that.
* Naya's liutenant, Proa, is made charge of finishing uncovering the PrecursorTower
* Ly, another Sage, begins her excavation of the SunkenTower.
* Naya in private knows that Prae is in possession of the singing blade as mentioned in the writings. 
* Still in collaboration with Naya, Most of the recovered Precursor material from the SunkenTower is reclaimed and transported in the creation of the Monastery, intended to help create and train new Precursors. 
* Naya discovers an in-dissrepair nim network. Which was once used to transport nim energies, presumably from the heart of the world to several identified and unidentified ruins. the largest discovery so far. 
* Naya questions it's existence, and disrepair, but begins restoring parts of the network. Towers generally held stored Nim energies.
* Sages begin finding Adamantine doors in many of these locations and ask Prae to investigate.
* Prae admits that the adamantine doors were used to seal away pocket dimensions. 
* The lum energies are stolen from the heart of the World. seperated between many sages.
* The heart is reconstituted in a weakened state.
* Metacrisis defenders, known as the Petrifach guard the heart from future attacks.
* Precursors struck with a blade of Petrifaction were turned to solid Adamantine, becoming statues.  
* and, unbeknownst to Prae, he had actually teleported beings to the past utilizing the Singing Sword.
* These were the beings that would construct Hiraeth, the Nim network, and the Precursor Towers.
* These beings from the past would return to the present in an attempt to defeat Prae. Prae won this conflict, and sealed the door with Adamantine.
* Naya and the Sages realize that their betrayal of Prae was performed in error; as they have created a dark past.

  

## Act 1\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Acts&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Act 1")\]

when the game begins, the player character is a normal blank canvas who has no awareness of the events that are unfolding around them. They have no energies and are a Pariah. From a friendly Precursor, They are given a single Nim. They can use this Nim to navigate StarterCavern solving simple puzzles. They will come across things such as Copper and unsolvable puzzles which cannot be solved until later. Upon leaving StarterCavern, the player arrives in InitialTown and meets the Sage. The main quest focuses on unblocking the waterfall in CliffsideCaves allowing energies to flow again.

by completing the DeliciousSoup quest you gain access to the Bottle, which is needed to take energies from the Pool this will allow the player to unlock the path to the PrecursorTower, completing a series of puzzles to do so. Inside the PrecursorTower the player will once again meet the Precursor. The player may choose to direct the newfound power from PrecursorTower to Hiraeth or to SecondTown. If the player chooses SecondTown then they must fight the Precursor.

During this same time, Proa has foresight that Macha will defeat him atop the Monastery. And in knowing so, sends Ly back to the past by destroing his part of the Dark Pearl This is an event which is observed in the far distance as a beam of light is shot into the sky signifying Proa's death Observing this beam of light at Hiraeth, Naya shatters his part of the Dark Pearl, also returning to the past.

the player returns to InitialTown, the world is now Dark, despite it being day. The town is empty, and the only thing that remains is the Green Pearl glowing in the Sage's hut. upon touching the pearl, the player will similarly be teleported to the past.

  

## Act 2\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Acts&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Act 2")\]

After arriving, the player will be confused. they will be in a large, metropolitan-esque city and will assume they have travelled to the future. All they have awareness of is Prae, Naya and the Sage.

  

  

Not long after this, those same Precursor warriors including Ly, invade InitialTown demanding the Pearl from the sage. The sage gives up the pearl and shortly afterwards is slain by Naya's general. the player meanwhile is able to escape to the Dark World. When the player initially reaches the Dark World they have no prior knowledge of it, and are unable to determine if it is the future or the past. The player will however assume that they are in the future given the metropolitan nature of Mar.

During the Dark world, the player learns that Naya possesses the pearl. and then believes that they have travelled to a hopeless future where Naya has won. all evidence points to this. it is however later revealed that they are actually in the past. that Naya was the original owner of the pearl, and that the Sage came into possession of the pearl by taking it from Naya. The players goal becomes undermining Naya's influence in both the LightWorld and DarkWorld.

The Pearl originally was owned by Naya, and he was given it by Prae, Naya then used the pearl to create his failed worlds, one of those worlds just so happened to be Mar.

The pocket watch in _12 Minutes_ was the wife’s father’s back when he was still alive, but, as revealed by the cop in subsequent loops, the wife supposedly murdered her father due to his abusive behavior. Eventually, the player is able to prove the wife’s innocence after discovering that her father wasn’t killed in the initial shooting, but several days after in another shooting. The realization of who actually killed the father begins dawning on the player after discovering that the father had an affair with a woman named Dahlia, who happens to be the player character’s mother.

It’s revealed that Dahlia’s son, _12 Minutes_’ protagonist, was the one who killed the wife’s father. What’s more, as the wife’s father is also the player character’s father, the couple realizes that they’re half-siblings in a horrid twist of fates. The player character, voiced by James McAvoy, reveals that he’s repressed the memory of murdering his own father which is why he had never brought it up to his wife. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, the wife is pregnant with the player’s child, bringing some major ethical questions into play.

The wife reveals that her mother always called the father’s bastard son “monster,” which were her father’s dying words spoken to the cop who enters the apartment every loop. The cop and the father were very close, which is why he feels entitled to the pocket watch that remains hidden by the wife, but upon realizing that the “monster” the father was referring to in his final moments was the player, he decides to take different actions.

After the dust settles of the main events of _12 Minutes_, it’s clear that the player character had much more relation to the central conflict than he was initially letting on. When the twist hits revealing that he’s related by blood to his pregnant wife, he transforms from an every-man relatable protagonist to someone more heinous and definitely much less relatable.
