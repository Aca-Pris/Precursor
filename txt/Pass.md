Within the natural fortress of the arboreal highlands, the precursor militia stood ceaseless vigil for several years defending not only the mountain pass but also the route to the mountain temple.

The lower stretches of Argap were full of vertiginous peaks. This path is at places a wide and pleasant valley, In other places it narrows to little more than an arms length.

## Gameplay\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Pass&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Gameplay")\]

The Pass is full of precursor guards from when it is first visited. It is very unlikely that the player will be able to get through the Pass. If the player is spotted, the Precursor militia will knock the player out, before transporting them to the [Monastery](https://nim.miraheze.org/wiki/Monastery "Monastery") where they will be forced to become a recruit.

As the player completes more of the Monastery questline, new areas will become neutral and accessible to them. After the questline is completed, Most of the Precursor guards will be neutral and the area will be mostly accessible.

Although seemingly impossible due to the height of the monastery walls and drop of the surrounding terrain, it is more than possible for the player to escape the Monastery, and as time progresses new escape options will become available.

the pass has points A and points B, but also C, in the middle if you are smart enough to find it.
