The sculptor is originally helped during a quest to restore their supply of Wet Plymetal.

after this quest, The Sculptor is able to sculpt items with Plymetal when shown items by the player. This can be incredibly useful to create specific items

The Scultor will refuse to sculpt Keys, as he believes it is unethical. The player can however sneak into his workshop to make a Key Mould.

* Chain - Player will recieve a Ring
