immutable alloy, also known as Precursor Metal contained a high amount of Phosphorus so that rust would stay superficial. The metal was immune to the passage of time, and existed far after ruins crumbled to dust.

It could only be created by binding lums to metal. because of this, the metal radiated lum energies.

On Mar, the metal is rediscovered in an already smelted state in the form of Precursor items, such as the [Shield](https://nim.miraheze.org/wiki/Warriors_Shield "Warriors Shield") or [Blade](https://nim.miraheze.org/wiki/Blade "Blade").

It is thought that the mines of [Protean Pass](https://nim.miraheze.org/wiki/Protean_Pass "Protean Pass") provided this strong but extremely light metal to Naya's armies, before it was bound with lum energies.
