##  Areas

An area is accessed and interacted with by the player and other characters and can contain creatures and quests and even items.

**Rules** \- The entirety of the rules section must be pasted into every new concept page. Certain rules can be removed, but many must be implemented.

**Ideas** \- These can be used for a new concept. only a handful may be used for a single concept.

## Rules

The following is a list of rules most areas must follow:

* If you go deeper content dramatically gets harder. loot obtained also dramatically gets better.
* the area is confined, but because it's confined, you can imagine the greater off-screen area. Can invoke imagination,
* over the course of the game, locations are entirely destroyed and captured by Naya, making them inaccessible, the player should aim to visit these prior to this; although this may not always be possible.
* Some areas should be impossible to survive, but lead to great reward.
* an area that you must complete a difficult and optional task in order to be able to unlock.
* You walk past things frequently that you'll later activate; like draining a lake or moving a statue.
* all areas link up to each other in winding and unexpected ways, you might anxiously follow an unknown path in an unknown area which reconnects to a cozy area you are already very much familiar with and gain that relief of familiarity straight after feeling you're far out of your depth.
* over the course of the game, locations are entirely destroyed and captured by Naya, making them inaccessible, the player should aim to visit these prior to this; although this may not always be possible.
* Objects that seem permanently built into the terrain can be activated, like platforms rising from the ground.
* You can perform tasks like digging for items.
* Mar has multiple states for different player choices.
* Content must be unlocked through choices. so if something isn't; the entire chain won't exist for the player.
* Treasures are never in plain sight.
* Cleared locations tend to repopulate with neutral characters overtime. who restore the area.
* Locations are tiered. Although you can see and access the inner layers. characters will be hostile.
* Seemingly meaningless and limited areas accessed previously open up more through quests.
* The game will present obstacles that are unassailable with the items the player currently has access to.
* The game presents a hurdle in several different forms. eventually presenting a solution.

* The landscape should merge with the building, the building should merge with the landscape.
* you should be able to see distant landmasses on the horizon where you can travel to eventually.  
* areas in complete ruin will start to grow new life from nothing.  
* the player may be too weak to do certain things, like pulling a rusted lever, they need Naya's Gauntlets to open these which they obtain far later in the game.  
* an item which is used to unblock certain doorways or chests, it is a difficult item to obtain which can halt progression.  

* Defeating main adversaries in areas will cure the area and lead to peace.  
* eliminating good factions will cause progress to cease entirely in areas.  
* areas are sometimes better if you get there much earlier than intended. as more time goes on, areas get less interesting or more destroyed.  
* pathways to later areas are blocked by powerful enemies, which you may or may not be able to sneak past.  
* The game is split up into chapters, nothing respawns during a chapter, but new things spawn at the beginning of a new chapter, and stories update, and people move locations.
* Some content is simply too hard for lore purposes and to make you feel less like a god. 
* The scope of the game is limited by content that is impossible to complete. There is no end. 

* No piece of content makes other content irrelevant, any new content adds to existing areas.
* Easy areas have extreme difficulty hidden in plain sight.
* areas that can only be accessed with specific items.
* Areas will be dormant, you can walk through the area and see some fascinating yet inactive things.
* areas that are inaccessible until a quest actually takes you through them.
* a massive tower you see in the distance for most of the game.

## Ideas

The following is a list of ideas not yet structured into areas.

* and soon these holdings would spread across the world, becoming known as Nayas empire.    
* living buildings constructed with lum energies were some of the distinguishing features of this domain.    
* scenic views from high cliffs showing most of the world.    
* when you reassemble the manual, it can be used to unlock an area permanently.    
* A cave which is occupied by a losing faction but serves as a good introductory dungeon experience.    
* it was a damp and muddy hole, with no wealth, but in this damp hole, was the lifeblood of an entire nation. the first vegetables planted soon sprouted, the nutirent-rich beds provided an unlimited font of potential, and so it sprung to life.    
* an object from a higher level adjacent zone is causing issues within a lower level one and is corrupting the land.    
* one of the first things you'll want to do is go to the graveyard, to find an incredibly rare item.    
* you get locked in a location until you are allowed to leave, and then you get quests to briefly leave that location, you can choose to leave entirely during these quests.    
* an area where you collect a unique buff item after every boss which can be used instantly or kept, the buffs interact in unique ways. if you use all of the buffs together, it is extremely powerful. if you don't use the items are all then you can use them to blast open a door to another boss and additional loot. The buffs can be used outside of the dungeon    
* you must pay an item to enter an area which allows you to buy more items.    
* an area of the game that starts with a corridor you can't pass without resistance gear    
* a location that was very important, but it's power in the world waned. It was then only guarded by a small handful of guards, who renamed it, before those guards were defeated.    
* areas that act as paths between point A and point B, unable to be accessed otherwise.     
* an area you can get to at the start of the game, but it can only really fully be explored and accessed far later into the game.     
* large ramps down a ravine/cliffside to the basin between the mountains.     
* usually you'll just be able to build one thing at a location, like a copper mine at a copper ore node, but from that, new buildings can be unlocked such as refineries, depending on other nearby towns with other resources, other buildings become available.     
* stuff you punch up from below (pillars you can stand on) hidden stuff behind stuff     
* two identical areas, one is accessible and can be explored normally, the other is inhabited by the enemy faction, this is to alert you to the scope of the enemy, without ever observing them directly.     
* put something in the game, that literally cannot ever be accessed until the next game in the series.     
* a location you were once inside, now viewing far away from the outside much later.     
* something discovered briefly far earlier that seems extremely significant, and is, but is sidelined for a long time, until it comes back into prominence and utmost importance.     
* the gear from an area is so hard to get and so good that it beats gear from newer content.     
* areas with inaccessible content that can only be accessed when actions are performed in an entirely different area (eco silos and vents)     
* the town is fine, but later into the game, the town is destroyed, and all the people in the town have relocated to a new location.     
* destroyed areas at the start of the game you can walk through, later you can restore and repair thanks to quests.    
* a cave that when drained opens up, draining more of the area opens more of it up.    
* door in a low level area that's locked with an obtainable key, it is a red rock castle portcullis at the end of a long grassy ravine, as enticing as possible, but the key can't be obtained until much later. an npc explains why the gate is locked. this is supposed to build up how difficult the area through the door is.
* the city is split into seperate sections.
* secret passages to inaccessible parts of future and past areas.
* a tree that has grown on the inside of a door frame, opening the old metal door.
* a door that seems static and unopenable for most of the game as part of an area with some npcs, you resign yourself to the fact the door is static and you'll never get beyond it, but then it opens much later.
* a store where you pay whatever you want for the goods purchased.
* an abandoned blacksmith with interesting research for your own.
* an area that is essentially a starting area without a starting faction there, so if you choose to abandon your current start, you can go here.
* when you defeat an enemy through influence, you gain access to the remainder of his resources, and his areas.

* Area called after an item; however, the item that is supposed to rest there, is no longer there.
* rehydrate plants, destroy a rock, a geyser fills the area with water.    
* a massive ruined tower, characters will talk about it's importance to the lore and what terrible events once transpired there, but now it's empty and rather tame.    
* start on top of a hill    
* an area is in constant sunset, suggesting what remains of the good times are about to end.

* an early game location is completely destroyed, and then can be revisited much later into the game, and rebuilt.
* A town which is situated in a very steep and sudden-edged valley, has it's surrounding area flooded occasionally, forming a large reservoir, which they still live inside. The buildings are tall enough that all of the main entrances are very high up, and the flooding really doesn't change that much.    
* area is visibly becoming flooded over time in one area of the game, later it is fully flooded.

*     a surface area which can only be accessed by an underground network of caves.
* there is a large calcium content in the surface soil.
* A huge area of land is named after one man, you only meet this man in person much later, and he explains why he is the name of the land.
* a zone that is hopeless and impossible, then an npc shows up to help...only after you've pretty much figured out it's impossible.
* a door that remains locked with people asking what lies beyond it.
* you go back to the first room from the beginning of the game, and it's now much more difficult.
* the exit to an area now becomes it's entrance upon return.

* During your time in an area it visibly increases in height and functionality.
* An area that is extremely difficult to get to, but when there is a haven, but you can't stay there for long. there is a very small area of the game where some drones ended up, and died of old age. you can read their data.
* a large almost city sized town that lies in ruins, and a team of builders is looking to reconstruct it, as the game progresses, buildings get more and more repaired.
* an old forgotten and buried temple the player finds, they can then restore it to it's former glory if they want, most of the temple requires archaeology to uncover, they can revive the ruined temple into a functioning temple with real members.
* an area of the game where taking equipment is forbidden by law.
* need to drain a large lake in order to enter the ruins below it and defeat the beast below, however this is seen as a very negative action.

## The world engine\[[edit](https://nim.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=Area&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: The world engine")\]

* something that was once a source of negativity is now a source of positivity.
