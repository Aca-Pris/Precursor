Draconis was once an intelligent beast, one of the last of his kind within the everlasting glade, where he would extort warriors of the time to obtain a wealth of lums. His roost is littered with corpses of ancient warriors from different periods of time, stretching to the mere beginnings of Mar.

It is thought that the beast predated lums, and gathered them to prevent lums causing attrition to the heart of the world, viewing lums as objectively negative energy. Whatever his intention, it seemed that he was in part successful, having enough to birth a diety.

Draconis is currently dormant.
