I spent today working on a 3D camera that appears in front of both the world
and the GUI viewports.

i'll need to spend more time tweaking it so that it is in the correct position.

my hope with the 3D camera is that I will be able to access not just 2D gui's
but also 3D positions.

although I could accomplish some of this with a 2D mouse,
it's far more limited, picking up a 3D item with a 2D mouse is limited.

I think the end goal is to have a hand that can hold not just world objects.
but also can be used as a tool, to drop coconuts from a tree, to mine a rock,
I can see a 3D mouse having some good utility.
