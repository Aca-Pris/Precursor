I want an item that acts like a bonfire/site of grace style thing, but I want
the item to be carryable, droppable, react to physics etc.

the idea is this object can be placed in an otherwise impossible to reach
location

such as dropped from the "bottom" of the bottomless cave, and landing on
one of the lower islands below.

this allows for it to be fast-travelled too.
