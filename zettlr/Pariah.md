Pariah were immortals created in the image of their creator, [Prae](https://nim.miraheze.org/wiki/Prae "Prae"), but were unfinished beings. his dreams being imperfect at the time of their creation.

despite this, the Pariah didn't perish in the basin after their creation, although the pariah were indeed wretched creatures that suffered from immense pain, struggling with the reality of emotion, thought and flesh they were able to do simple tasks like walk, which eventually led to them falling.

it is thought that many pariah did choose to fall to the lower planes, believing that this would end their torment. however, on the lower planes, time passed far slower. this allowed the pariah the time required to conquer their flaws. These pariah who fell, now wise and experienced insinuated their way back onto Mar, and now seek out places of natural worth.

Pariah have extremely long life spans, able to exist upon lingering energies for hundreds of years. and as well, they may too, grow old and age in a similar way to Precursors. Â 

Some had taken their own lives rather than live in constant torment, and those that lingered had questions, who was their creator? why did he create the Pariah? who created the ruins that littered the planet? how did he harness lums, the life energy of the world? what was his purpose? and why did he vanish?

Pariah when exposed to the volatile energies of lums were transformed into Precursors, much stronger hardier beings.
