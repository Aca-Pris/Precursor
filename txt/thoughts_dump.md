you gain temporary access to a far later part of the game at the beginning
this temporary access ends when you die, but you get to keep whatever you picked up

the only thing that limits you are mechanics like the hookshot being required to scale a wall etc

if you are unawble to wield a weapon, precursor enhancements can help you reach these thresholds
this is absolutely required for some equipment w`		hich is impossible to be used without it


precursor shards are required, and are the main bottle-neck in upgrading your equipment.



--------------------------
Age of Ash:
--------------------------

T: This world was a mystery to me when I first arrived here, from where, I do not recall.
T: It was a wasteland of white ash. and inside some fractured monuments were lords holding large wealths of lums
T: I conquered them all.
T: I used their coveted lums to create a new power source for this dead world; which I called the heart.
T: I created the Sages, to rule in place of these former lords, and establish their domains.

Tsaru stands as the sole being alive after anhiliating his last foe.
He has become a god-like figure with a massive wealth of lums to spend
The world is coated in thick layers of ash, and is barren of all life.

he resculpts a land to be more hospitible, using a large majority of his lums in doing so

he names the new land Mar.
using a majority of his power, he constructs the heart of the world, intended as it's new power source
the world itself is still a lifeless husk as the result of the Ageless Ages



T: Using hidden lums, and forgotten knowledge, I was able to create Orbs capable of generating Eco, and I gave these
to my Sages:
-----------------------
The Age of Rediscovery:
------------------------
before the destruction:

Q: What if someone were to go against the order you have created here?
if they destroyed the heart?

T: Who?

Q: One of the sages perhaps. irritated by your dominion over the heart.

T: My sages are wise enough to know, that should they attack the heart, then the world would be destroyed



During the Age of Drought evacuation:

T: I have gathered you here to explain our situation in regards to the heart.
T: The heart is slowly growing, and should produce the lums we require.
T: However, this process will take a significant period of time. and in the interim, we exist in an age of drought.

T: I offer you, my Sages, the ability to leave Mar for a time, to exist within your own domains, governed by
yourselves as you see fit. and in time, may we all return to Mar in a new Age.

Q: If you seek to seal these domains, how can we be certain that they will not become prisons?

T: I do not seek to seal the domains, however, I wish for restraint to be used when accessing Mar. The world
must be allowed to heal, and build itself.


There is a quest to retrieve an artifact so that an NPC can become a god again
but there is another hidden option to simply use that artefact yourself to become a god
doing so draws the Ire of Azura. Spawning unique enemies that are incredibly powerful
the player can choose to return the power to azura, and is instead granted a weapon attachment
that deletes difficult enemies by sending them to another plane, the Ethereal Blade
it is difficult to do and most players won't be able to accomplish it earlier into the game




You can type prompts to NPC's.
-------------------------------------------
Mining Laser
The player can find a mining laser relatively early. Designed for mining, it is a weak but accurate weapon.
the Mining laser relies on depleted eco capsules scarcely found in mines.
Due to it's initial weaknesses and limitations, the player may choose to abandon the weapon in favour of another.


a blue shot is fired immediately after a mouse click to the mouse position,
it is quite weak.

the mining laser causes a minor recoil effect for the target, if the target is mechanical, can cause minor
breaks if enough shots hit weak points.

Upgrades:
Ecowave (blue eco tier 1) - an NPC offers to make some initial modifications to the mining laser, so that it can use more powerful
blue eco capsules. It now fires a blast wave that is on-par with the Power Fist.

"How interesting, it seems that the Sage developed some kind of Orb attachment mechanism allowing even unhallowed precursors to channel it's energies"

"I can channel the power of the Sages Orb through the mining laser and the prototype attachment. this would allow you to create rock outcrops.
using the orb, either to weigh down enemies, or to attach things to the landscape.

----------------------------------------------

Grav Board

Used for traversal, like a skateboard but it hovers

Jet Board Spinner Module

Allows you to connect to specific rails to traverse vertically using the Jet Board.


------
Droidsmith - severed at the legs, originally found unpowered in the ancient mine.

You have the Precursors, and then you have the ecclesiarchy. Ecclesiastical Items are far rarer of course, as they were used only by the Sages or Naya directly.
some examples of Ecclesiastical items might be Sage Orbs, the very orbs that were once used to create many aspects of Mar,
and by extension, interfaces which then allow those Ecclesiastical objects to interact with precursor technologies, often created by said Sages.

As a reminder, the Ecclesiarchy very rarely used Precursor items or equipment, and instead opted for Adamantine.
So you could also consider Adamantine equipment to be Ecclesiastical.   



The Precursors had a strange habit of creating technologies that could be repurposed, modified, and were modular with enough effort.
If you bring me Precursor technologies, I can rediscover ways to modify your existing equipment

The Precursors used traditional jewelry sockets before upgrading to engineered sockets. Only Precursor Sages were capable of making Eco Gems


You might ask, why can't I just use bottles to store Eco? That mining laser of yours has a Socket.

The main issue with that bottle of yours is, although it can store Eco, it can't be used with a socket.

Siphons can be used with a Socket, but they can only be used with a stationary source of Eco, such as a pool or vent.

Flasks are essentially a bottle that can be used to store eco, but due to their size many were melted and reclaimed, or
destroyed by Naya and are therefore rarer to discover.


-------------------------------------------

Bottle of Eco
"Contains enough energy to perform tasks for a finite time"

Eco Battery
"A condensed storage of Eco"

Grav Booster

"Ah yes, a booster,
It is an interesting artifact that once functioned on Red Eco.
In it's current state and you could use it to boost, given that you have a
alternatively, I could use the parts to modify your Mining Laser, allowing it to fire a strong wave of eco energy.

Enables a third boost after a double jump, serving as a triple jump



---------------------


Power Fist
The Power fist is the intended initial upgrade from the mining laser, allowing combat abilities to be enhanced
against mechanical targets and encouraging a melee playstle.

Using a power fist, the player can knock down targets given that they have a source of Blue Eco.

Power Guantlet
Lacking physical capabilities, the power guantlet can be used to channel blue eco,


That trinket. I'd reccomend laying it to rest here.
It is said they who carry this trinket are sure to cause great misery
you do not intend such misery, do you?

Ah, then I have no choice. I cannot allow one who would sow misery to pass.


They were praetorians once, part of the Nayan Protectorate.
they discovered some furnace that turned lums into eco,
ever since, that place has been churning out a whole lot of dark eco
Maybe you could convince them to make something positive, blue eco, green eco, anything.  


Your soul is not a creation of Tsaru, yet the avatar your soul inhabits, is.
You are perrenial ash. then, emboldened by a soul, and secondly cursed with both flesh and mortality.
your heart remains a vessel of Precursor metal.

Yes, flesh is more-so a curse.     

I see now, You have lost several parts of your soul reaching this place.
I can tie your soul here, that way, if your soul should wander, it may be placed into a new avatar.
Tsaru did not create you. He made this vessel, and many others like it. including my own, yet he did not
make you.

I am a sculptor, I do not follow Tsaru, but I am familiar with the craft of Avatars.
I reverse-eningeered some of Tsaru's creations, discovering he was not the god he claimed to be.
I help wayward souls find their way back to Mar.

the droids, they made vessels too, vessels unlinked to Tsaru.
I am sure the droids would be able to assist you too.

The sculptor sculpts stone avatars, and souls find themselves into the precursor heart within these avatars.




I am less concerned about the content of the Domains, as there are so many lost or neglected ones.
I am more so interested in what paths they may lead too, elsewhere.


Godhand Item
Allows the player to enter a topdown view where they can perform abilities given they have enough access to
blue eco, which usually means having access to a blue eco pool or vent.



When the player begins they will be at the bottom of a well lit cavern, they must jump upwards

they can punch plants to obtain sticks
they can punch through vine doors and climb on vine walls.
they can pick up rocks to use on precursor switches, to open precursor doors.
plants will drop a pool of green eco, but the player will not be able to interact with it until later.


they will meet the wounded warrior next to an open precursor door.

"This place is Elas, or what remains of it."
"You should make your way to the tower in the distance."


will only be able to bathe in a blue eco pool to gain a temporary boost,
this will also allow them to interact with blue eco powered doors.

They will then obtain the bottle from a chest in an abandoned research lab,
allowing them to store a small amount of blue eco for areas where there are no sources of blue eco






The player starts
they will fight the wounded precursor

wounded precursor drops:
Ico absorption Matrix
- Allows for the consumption of Dark Eco

Ico conversion Matrix
- Turns Blue Eco into Dark Eco


The player can use these as-is to use Dark Eco.



"Remarkably, I could reverse the polarity of these devices, instead of producing dark eco, they can instead
produce blue eco, fascinating."




Precursor Guantlet
These guantlets are powerful artifacts used by only Naya's closest liutenants. being in posession of this is rare.
Sadly, this one seems to function on dark eco and dark eco alone. Meaning other forms of eco have to be corrupted


Crystals are created by spending a lum to cast Harden Eco on Blue Eco
by using the Bottle Mould within the forgotten lab, the player is able to create new Bottles, which can store Eco.
crystals crystalize nearby sources of blue eco, this can lead to crystalized pools of blue eco.
crystals give off a faint blue glow.
blue eco can also be placed in moulds, where it can freeze into specific forms.
Crystal can be planted into dirt, and this gradually releases blue eco into the surrounding soil
crystals can be infused with a lum.

Certain Precursor Permutations are discovered, for example, combining a panelized module with a Mining Laser creates
the Knockback Gun

You ARE Naya, you are basically just a copy of him, and Naya is a copy of


The domain inside the pocket realm must be restored, so that water can once again pour down from it.


A precursor assembly line which is producing an item and you don't know what the item actually is until you scan it


You are able to scan most objects, this is mainly useful for Prefabricated Precursor equipment

Using the Item Scanner, you are able to discover that the Mining Laser has a Projector Module


The key is the Mining Lasers Projector.

-----------

Ah a precursor bumper shield.

It can be used to knock enemies off surfaces using Red Eco, it does this using a booster panel module.

It is possible to turn a booster module into a panelized module.

It can also be placed on the ground and be activated remotely. and also recalled using a precursor guantlet,
assuming you have one of those.

We are the Outpost team.
We are a team of Petrifachs sent from the heart of the world, Our role is to investigate the Precursor vault here,
and establish excavation efforts.

Firstly, we should focus on re-activating the Waygate, allowing equipment to be sent from the heart of the world.

Tsaru expects us to re-establish communications within 14 days.

------
(Waygate re-activated)
"It's good to see that you are making progress. This pearl may be used to manipulate terrarin, it will be required
to reach the vault. I entrust it to you.  

--------
Nayan Protectorate.
The Nayan outpost of Burnt Pillar is nearby; The Nayans may also be looking for ruins.
We will try to avoid them if possible.

--------------

Nayan approach

Greetings Petrifach, this region is owned by the Nayan Protectorate. and so we must demand that you pay a tax
to stay on our grounds




Communications Silent
The Capital is Silent, our orders are now uncertain. Many seek to continue the excavation
of the ruins. others wish to redirect our research efforts towards the sea.

------------
Wounded Petrifach

A wounded petrifach has arrived via the waygate
"close the gate, the Nayans will access it"

What should we do?
Close the Waygate.
Keep the Waygate open; but send Guards to monitor further incidnts.

Send a small group through the Waygate.
Our group enters the waygate and discovered many petrifach. many dead, and some wounded.
We recovered the wounded, and their equipment
-----------------
Flooding incident.

Our guards at the waygate were able to close the Waygate at the first signs of water, the waygate remains
functional. We should open a connection elsewhere, if we are able.

Whilst we weren't looking, The waygate began spilling large amounts of water, enough that the waygate itself
was damaged.

it would be unwise to reactive the link to the heart of the world at this time.
-------------



The oncoming flood.
Naya has slain Tsaru, the heart of the world has been flooded. We know that Naya intends to further flood the land
the future is uncertain, however we are surviving, for now.

We should focus our research efforts towards


The island is now slowly sinking. and we must construct a raft to leave the island with as many people as possible
we anticipate that we have less than five weeks to build the raft.

Up to our ankles.
The water level has reached dangerous levels. our time on the island is nearing it's final days.


The great voyage.
With most of the land now beneath the waves, it is impossible to do certain things, however, we have survived.



The raft

The heart of the world


you start on the island
you are informed by the statue that the heart is below the ground but that it has been flooded with blue eco, which it had
been producing endlessly before it became flooded.

and that the blue eco is incredibly valuable.

The statue tells you that the sky is illusionary, and that you must defeat Ora Kas,
you fight Ora kas and the sky illusion fades, revealing that you are actually in a dark cave.
Defeating Ora Kas awards his portal stone which you can activate thanks to the statue.

the next step is to destroy the boulders, allowing the blue eco to drain into the dry world.


you find the bomb plant, which you must rejuvenate, and you find the preserved bomb plant seeds.
you must then travel back to the wet world, planting the seeds, and coming back sometime later, you destroy the boulders, and then the blue eco sea begins to drain
into the dry world.

you may now gain access to the previously inaccessible first heart chamber, and can even dive down into the second one
which contains some junk adamantine items.

However further exploration is impossible due to adamantine doors sealing the way.

revisiting the dry world, a small lake of blue eco has formed.
but you also discover that it is leading to a cavern
following the cavern downwards, you see it leads to another portal
when you enter this portal you will be in an empty expanse where the eco is being ejected into the ether.

you must go to the nearby tower to destroy the portal stone, which closes this portal.
The lake now continues to expand.

however, you find that the flow has stopped. you travel back to the wet world to find that Naya has resealed where the boulders were with precursor metal.
it is here you fight Naya. you lose, and you are thrown from the domain, and the domain is closed.

(in this world, the sea has drained to such an extent that the ititial island is now like a plataeu.

The last boss is intended not to be beaten by any player. even if they use things like Cheatengine.


Boss 1: Unwinnable Battle against Naya
Although the player cannot hope to win against Naya, If they put up a good fight, they can damage threshold Naya, to make him drop the Adamantine Armor Chunk
This is a visual change which can be seen throughout the game.
The adamantine chunk automatically slides off the monastery into the river bed.
The player can find the hidden burnt blade in the arena, which can also be thrown off the monastery, which is actually a Precursor Blade.  
If the player fails to do this prior to being stabbed in the chest, these items will be unobtainable.


"Place me in Adamantine"
Upon beng placed in adamantine, the gem will claim that they are a god, who was defeated by Naya.



Didn't I tell you before?
This journey is a fools errand.

The burnt blade


The ending blade
the player will be warned several times before the fight that the blade will delete their save upon death
the blade can be hidden prior to the start of the fight which removes the severity



"I can fragment your soul. That will allow you to escape outside of the Adamantine Citadel.
one part must remain inside your body; where it will be slain by Naya.

With soul splitting comes a connection to the ethereal plane - it will allow you to communicate with the Adamantine statues.
You soul can reclaim your body afterwards.


I can send fragments of your soul to other Domains, but it is likely that you will lose that fragment in the process
in an attempt to gain what you hope to possess

Tsaru is an outer god, he didn't come from any usual domain, but somehow came from an entirely different world
when he arrived here, he brought with him Adamantine, and subjugated the heart that had already been here for time immemoral.



"Why split my soul and sacrafice it to Naya?"
It is your only way out of this place without losing yourself entirely

"Why not simply help me escape?"
Praetorian guards have the ability to send you to other Domains; and it's likely you'd have your soul imprisoned there indefinetely.

"Can I recover that part of my soul?"
That part of your soul will likely be locked by Naya inside a Domain.
Although it may be possible to eventually go to that Domain, it would be long after Naya's defeat

"[Speech 50] A Precursor knight was burnt alive in that arena, and it is said that his blade was left in a pile of ash, I'd look for that ash covered sword, if you seek to win.


Boss 2: Illusionary Naya
You can entirely bypass the first boss, and he is not intended to be killed.
he was placed here intentionally to act as an impossible barrier, but he can be bypassed



Precursor Rod.
The Precursor Rod is a powerful device which is capable of being charged with blue eco upon attacking
the blue eco can then be released in waves to cause damage.
the precursor Rod scales with Blue Eco.

Iridescent Eco

Prismatic Eco
Prismatic eco is created by taking red, blue, yellow and green eco and combining them, but without the inclusion of
white eco these ecos instead form a glassy crystaline structure.
Items made of this crystal are usually called Prismatic items.

Chromatic Eco


We want some gameplay basically like the Pocket God iphone game

Peolple drank Adamantial, becoming wyrms, and eventually dragons.

Empyrean Tsaru
Old Lathia

"You see, this adamantine citadel. It was constructed by the Lathian Protectorate, It did not exist in Pathe's time.
And the Nayan Protectorate simply incorporated the Lathian beliefs. However, the Heart itself has a will of
it's own. they are not serving the heart, even if most believe so. They serve Naya."

"Only Empyreans like Tsaru can forge Adamantine. They say it is not just his access to lums, but his status
as an Empyrean. almost like, chosen to be ruler. but by whom?"

"Even if you were able to access the lums, you would not be able to make Adamantine"

"The heart has actually been reformed many times, we can see this in the Adamantine Vault; what is depicted within
is a far more powerful heart. predating Tsaru.


They had the power and ability to destroy Naya, realizing this, Naya's followers
disabled death so that Naya couldn't be slain

Time moves differently here, the blue eco that drips here will flood the land of Mar.
"however, in return for this gift, my domain will be sealed as I do not wish to interfere further"
the level can be adjusted, you can have a lake of blue eco, a pond, or none at all.  


Adamantine Shell
it comes in 6 parts, it can function with a single part, but a fully upgraded item will have all 6 parts.


She was going to have a soul death, so she managed to cause another person to have a soul death to prevent
her own, this allowed her soul to travel through time by being stored in adamantial

The Precursors that are known to exist are not the only ones that do, infact there are many other precursors
that existed but died nameless.




Upon him becoming a god, Tsaru removed his power and offered him a domain far from Mar.

All of thoese who were locked in Domains were freed to roam Mar once again



He was thrown into the new heart, and created Haligheart the roots spread upwards and corrupted the land,
so the land was raised, so that it could be saved.


all weapons i the game are trash except the ones handed out by the second last boss.

the playe rmight make the mistake of picking up these weapons.
but if they do the last boss destroys them all at the start of the fight.

we don't have enough power to restart the world..
but we do have enough, to fuel a hero, who could potentially save it.. one day.


ability combos that FEEL INCOMPLETE that they COULD be so great if they did X all of the other parts are there except that one part.
later into the game, you recieve that part, but only AFTER that initial frustration.

an ability that feels completely worthless, and is, until you get a piece of equipment which gives it a seemingly, at first, insignificant improvement
that is until you realize how powerful this ability actually is.

it's beneficial to get all of the improvements to unlock the final (keystone) improvements.

They could choose to exist, but instead, they give this up to restart their entire race., and create a seed that can be planted to grow a tree


an item that when you have the other item, the effect of the first item is greatly increased.


an item from far earlier in the game that you don't really ever want to use as it's effect is a one-time and very powerful use.
the item can only be used once, instantly for great effect, or used slower over a long period of time using an object discovered later into the game.

The towers have no way of being accessed unless the player can levitate.


The antagonist is trying to control all of the water in the region.
however, a small faction is actually able to convert earth to water. the antagonist was completely unaware that this decimates their plans.

The organisation stays extremely quiet and hidden, but the members exist in plain sight.


the game feels bullshit, as if it's been purposefully rigged against you
but then after your initial frustration
you see a hole that you can exploit.
however, this is in fact the intended method.


a prisoner in the basement of your hideout, he is intelligent, and would be a boss if not for already being imprisoned, he helps you.

they attempted to establish a new system of order on top of the previous old one, this location, and the tree were parts of the new system, you can choose to unfurl them, to
return to the old one.

the metal fish must be added to the soup to prevent it from being posionous.

the final boss is just a shadow unless you kill the other bosses

they were seen as protectors, once, although, until it was eventually discovered that their actions were in malice.


There is a neutral character at the start
you think the good guy is bad
and that the bad guy is good
until you meet all three in a room, the neutral character explains that the bad character is good
the neutral character themselves becomes bad, however not through their own choice.


You are in a losing situation and will eventually sucumb
however, an unknown figure saves you without revealing themselves.


The store sells many items, some of which are intended to be out of the reach of the player earlier into the game. The store will also be out of stock of some items and be relatively bare at the beginning of the game.

However, the player can still obtain these exceptionally powerful items far earlier than intended if they follow specific steps to do so.

Later into the game, many of the items that were astronomically priced will be significantly reduced and become regularly obtainable.

Some items require to be unlocked or steps to be conducted to allow the transport of items from one location to another.


An item might require exactly 56 of something, however to reach that exact number would require a very specific combination of components.
Knowing which components to be used to reach the exact value of 56 requires actual mathematical skill


A piece of equipment that allows you to combine two other pieces of equipment, or abilities, in a way that they previously couldn't be combined, giving synergy where there was none previously
