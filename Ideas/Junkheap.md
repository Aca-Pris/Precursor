Metal, especially better metal, can be scarce. so you need to decide what you spend it on.

Spending it on rivets or sawblades, although powerful in combat, means that it won't be available for other things.

Early into the game the player will really only have access to precursor metal or ancient metal.

The hope is that the player decides that precursor metal is too precious to be made into a bunch of rivets or components for the rivet gun.

but the player has the freedom to do that, if they so wish.

The player comes across the conduit, and weighed boots first, so the hope is that they'll repair one of those using metal from the shield.

Conduit

The conduit can be used to channel eco energies and manipulate them in several ways.

The conduit is modifiable

It can fire small beads of eco

it can be charged to fire a larger ball of eco.

or it can even fire a consistent beam of eco, at extreme eco cost, doing so damages the weapon.

Slicer

The Slicer is an available modification for the Caster

fires a sawblade, if the sawblade intersects with a limb it can break the limb or tear it off entirely.

Sawblades can be created through the Smithing skill

Also useful for cutting ropes.

Tether

Can be used on an available tether-point to tether to that location. Locations may include hanging vines or actual tether-points.

It is discovered as a Precursor Device upon talking to the blacksmith it requires a Winding Mechanism to be repaired

The player must choose between the caster or the tether, and can only have one.

To turn a tether into a Caster the winding mechanism but be replaced with a charge mechanism.

The winding mechanism can be recreated using precursor metal, or can be found behind a precursor door.

If the player finds a second mechanism, it can be melted down for precursor metal.

The tether can also be further upgraded to target droids. - the tethered droid becomes fully under control of the tetherer

Overheats and has a long cooldown

Caster

Fires a wooden or full-metal arrow which impales a target.

It is discovered as a Precursor Device upon taking it to the blacksmith it requires a Charge Mechanism to be repaired.

The player must choose between the caster or the tether, and can only have one.

metal arrows can be fired at increased velocity.

Arrow can be created through the Smelting and then engineering skill.

rivets can be retrieved from fallen enemies.

Wrench

Dismantle yourself into different parts.

After a boss fight you are corrupted.

Enemy:

The AI enemy can't be slain, it'll rebuild itself, even if you remove components.

An AI enemy has that flimsy damagable/removable arms/legs/neck

A character who rules over the town, and is losing the war, and the town is becoming increasingly hateful of the ruler.

however, even after the ruler is replaced, the issues are very real. - he was simply doing his best under the circumstances.

Guards.

more powerful Nayan guards have yellow blood. this is because they have yellow eco flowing through them.
