## Adamantine

Adamantine is an impossibly heavy and tough metal that can only be wielded by those who posess a precursor bracelet; of which very few exist. It is often immovable and unbreakable once in place as a result of it's weight. 
It is used in many precursor statues, and is formed via petrifaction.

## Adamantial

Adamantial is created when a being ingests Saridial prior to Petrifaction. It shares most properties of Saridial except can harden to mimic adamantine.


## Imuril

Precursor metal is a red-coloured incredibly strong and light material, however exceptionally rare. many instead melt down or repair existing Precursor items. Precursor items of worth are usually hoarded and taken by members of the Nayan Protectorate. Although Stronger materials do exist, they are usually unobtainable by most if not all of Mar's inhabitants. Is immune to rust.

##  Saridial

A silvery liquid metal impractical for most purposes, found in caverns. However if ingested, it is known to significantlly lessen the effect of Petrifaction blades and can form Adamantial. 

## Iridial

the only metal known to be able to slice Adamantial. and is exceptionally hard to find. some legendary weapons were made using it.


## Oridial

An incredibly soft metal that can be molded like wet clay. but impossible to harden and therefore relatively useless. seeds often get trapped in and root from the metal.

## Plyril

alloy created by adding a small amount of Precine to Oridial, creating a rough but hardy metal.

## Dwyindylem
